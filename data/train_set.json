Professional identity consists of the individual's alignment of roles, responsibilities, values, and ethical standards to be consistent with practices accepted by their specific profession. Sources of professional identification Researchers have found that a desire for quality (rather than profits) is associated with professional identification. Organizations tend to be concerned with efficiency and profitability, whereas professions care mainly about providing the highest-quality service (as defined by the professions), almost regardless of cost or revenue considerations (Freidson, 2001). Administrators are usually seen as promoting profitability at the expense of profession-defined quality (Freidson, 2001). In one notable study, practicing physicians viewed administrators with medical degrees (e.g., the M.D.) as \u201coutsiders\u201d to the medical profession because of what the physicians believed to be the administrators\u2019 undue emphasis on organizational goals (Hoff, 1999: 336).

Openness involves six facets, or dimensions: active imagination (fantasy), aesthetic sensitivity, attentiveness to inner feelings, preference for variety (adventurousness), intellectual curiosity, and challenging authority (psychological liberalism). A great deal of psychometric research has demonstrated that these facets or qualities are significantly correlated. Thus, openness can be viewed as a global personality trait consisting of a set of specific traits, habits, and tendencies that cluster together. Openness tends to be normally distributed with a small number of individuals scoring extremely high or low on the trait, and most people scoring moderately. People who score low on openness are considered to be closed to experience. They tend to be conventional and traditional in their outlook and behavior. They prefer familiar routines to new experiences, and generally have a narrower range of interests. Openness has moderate positive relationships with creativity, intelligence and knowledge. Openness is related to the psychological trait of absorption, and like absorption has a modest relationship to individual differences in hypnotic susceptibility.","label":1},{"id":66,"text":"Property developer falsely accused neighbour 's son-in-law of racist assault .

It can take many forms, from false claims of charitable donations to falsifying documentation or bilking donors of their money. Charity fraud is a serious problem, costing charity organizations millions of dollars each year. It can also damage the reputation of charities and lead to reduced donations from potential donors. In some cases, charity fraudsters have even stolen donations intended for charitable purposes. There are several ways that charity fraudsters can exploit the trust of their victims. They may make false claims about the amount of money that their organization has raised or the use that it has made of the funds. They may falsify documents to make it appear as if the organization is more effective than it actually is. Or they may simply steal money from donors by pretending to spend it on charitable purposes when in fact they are spending it on themselves. Whatever form it takes, charity fraud is a criminal offense that should be avoided at all costs. If you are suspicious about any activity that your charity is involved in, please do not hesitate to contact your local police department or the charity's own audit department.

It can also be seen as the totality of the ways in which people interact with each other and their environment. Non-material culture includes everything from traditional clothing to folk music to cooking techniques. It can be found in every corner of the world, and it often has a unique and distinct flavor.

The game is set in the Sinnoh region and follows the story of a young Trainer as they adventure around the region and battle with various Pok\u00e9mon. The game also introduces three new types of Pok\u00e9mon: Steel-, Dark-, and Ghost-type Pok\u00e9mon.

It is sometimes considered synonymous with the mainline Protestant denominations, though it also has adherents in other traditions. Liberal Christianity began to emerge in the late eighteenth century as a reaction against traditional Protestantism. The leaders of this movement believed that the doctrines of predestination and election were antithetical to human freedom and equality, and that the sacraments should be viewed merely as symbols of grace rather than as means of salvation. They also believed that the Bible should be read without comment or interpretation, and that biblical morality should be applied without regard to social customs or economic conditions. Today, liberal Christianity is represented by a variety of religious denominations and groups. It is strongest among Protestant denominations in North America and Europe, but has also adherents among Catholics, Orthodox Christians, and members of other religious traditions. Liberal Christianity has played an important role in the development of critical thinking and religious pluralism within Protestantism, and has helped to foster relationships between different religious groups.","label":0},{"id":229,"text":"At 13 , Laura Scurr went on a diet which would turn into a scary obsession .

Neomercantilism is the dominant school of thought in mainstream economics, which holds that increasing exports and creating a trade surplus is the key to sustained economic growth. The theory has been discredited by many economists, who argue that it is not always feasible to increase exports, and that trying to do so can lead to trade wars and other harmful consequences. The term \"neo-mercantilism\" was first used in the 1930s by economist Joseph Schumpeter to describe the policy of governments during the Great Depression of trying to increase exports to revive their economies. Neomercantilism has been a dominant school of thought in mainstream economics since its inception, and has been criticized for its adherence to mercantilist thinking, which holds that the wealth of a nation is determined by the amount of goods and services it exports.","label":0},{"id":268,"text":"Marc Wabafiyebazu and his 15-year-old brother Jean were arrested in Miami on March 30.

The movement later merged with the ancient Bhagavata tradition and contributed to the development of Vaishnavism. The Pancharatra movement created numerous literary treatises in Sanskrit called the Pancharatra Samhitas, and these have been influential Agamic texts within the theistic Vaishnava movements. Literally meaning five nights (pa\u00f1ca: five, r\u0101tra: nights), the term Pancharatra has been variously interpreted. The term has been attributed to a sage Narayana who performed a sacrifice for five nights and became a transcendent being and one with all beings. The Pancharatra Agamas constitute some of the most important texts of many Vaishnava philosophies including the Madhva Sampradaya or Brahma Sampradaya of Madhvacharya and the Sri Vaishnava Sampradaya of Ramanuja.

The Fundamentalist\u2013Modernist controversy emerged in the early 20th century as a battle between two schools of thought within Christianity: Fundamentalists, who defended traditional interpretations of the Bible, and Modernists, who argued that the Bible should be read in light of current scientific and historical knowledge. The debate intensified in 1925 when Christian theologian Reinhold Niebuhr published his book The Nature and Destiny of Man, which attacked traditional Protestant doctrines in favor of a synthesis of Christianity and secular philosophy. The Fundamentalist\u2013Modernist controversy reached a critical point in 1948 when the General Assembly of the World Council of Churches met in Amsterdam to discuss the issue. There, Modernists gained a majority and passed a resolution calling for a reconsideration of the Bible's teachings on science, history, and other subjects. This resolution led to a decline in membership in mainline Protestant churches, which were now perceived as being too aligned with Modernism. The Fundamentalist\u2013Modernist controversy has largely subsided since then, but it remains a significant issue within Christianity. Today, there are still some Fundamentalists who defend traditional interpretations of the Bible against Modernists, but the majority of Christians have moved away from the Fundamentalist\u2013Modernist controversy and have adopted a more moderate stance.","label":0},{"id":374,"text":"Jon Reiter was attempting his first climb to the summit at the time .

The entrance to the site is located on Iona Road, approximately three kilometres south of Iona Ontario, Canada. A double oval ring of raised earthworks surrounds the remains of the village. Background Occupied between AD 1450 and 1550, it is located in southwestern Ontario in rural Elgin County, near the banks of a tributary of Talbot Creek, approximately 20\u00a0km west of St. Thomas, Ontario. Archaeological investigations have indicated the presence at one time of eighteen longhouses of various sizes within the village, with an estimated population of 800-900 people. These native inhabitants were the Attiwandaronk (Attarawandon) Indians, an Iroquoian-speaking people called the Neutrals by the French colonists. An open area in the centre of the community appears to have provided a common activity area or meeting place.

The system consisted of up to twenty symbols, each of which represented one of the 20 units in the Muisca decimal system. The Muisca were a people who lived in the highlands of present-day Colombia during the Early Pre-Columbian period. They were one of the most important cultural and linguistic groups in South America, and their numerals were one of the most complex and advanced systems used in the region. The Muisca numerals were based on a vigesimal system, using 20 symbols to represent 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, and 500. Each symbol represented one of the units in the Muisca decimal system: 1 = cuzco; 2 = biti; 3 = quinchu; 4 = yanacona; 5 = tukur\u00ed; 10 = cincuenta; 20 = doscientos; 50 = cien; 100 = mil; 500 = quinientos.

Their debut album, \"Mass\", was released in 1998 on the British label Cuneiform Records. In 2002, Blanck Mass released their second album, \"Tenebrae\".

In a PDM signal, specific amplitude values are not encoded into codewords of pulses of different weight as they would be in pulse-code modulation (PCM); rather, the relative density of the pulses corresponds to the analog signal's amplitude. The output of a 1-bit DAC is the same as the PDM encoding of the signal. Pulse-width modulation (PWM) is a special case of PDM where the switching frequency is fixed and all the pulses corresponding to one sample are contiguous in the digital signal. For a 50% voltage with a resolution of 8-bits, a PWM waveform will turn on for 128 clock cycles and then off for the remaining 128 cycles. With PDM and the same clock rate the signal would alternate between on and off every other cycle. The average is 50% for both waveforms, but the PDM signal switches more often. For 100% or 0% level, they are the same.

With repeated exposure of Osemozotan at the 5-HT1A receptors, there seems to be no change in the number of receptors, which is not typically seen with pharmaceutical agonists.","label":1},{"id":467,"text":"dr. derek shepherd dies on \"grey's anatomy\" he was played by patrick dempsey .","label":0},{"id":468,"text":"Poll reveals how Britons consume an average of 17 cups of tea each week .

Local historians have always written about their own cities. Starting in the 1920s, and led by Arthur Schlesinger, Sr. at Harvard, professional historians began comparative analysis of what cities have in common, and started using theoretical models and scholarly biographies of specific cities. The United States has also had a long history of hostility to the city, as characterized for example by Thomas Jefferson's agrarianism and the Populist movement of the 1890s. Mary Sies (2003) argues: Historiography  American urban history is a branch of the history of the United States and of the broader field of Urban history. That field of history examines the historical development of cities and towns, and the process of urbanization. The approach is often multidisciplinary, crossing boundaries into fields like social history, architectural history, urban sociology, urban geography business history, and even archaeology. Urbanization and industrialization were popular themes for 20th-century historians, often tied to an implicit model of modernization, or the transformation of rural traditional societies.","label":1},{"id":483,"text":"The clip was uploaded by YouTube user honda4ridered .

A similar term, mean circulatory filling pressure, (MCFP) is defined as the mean pressure that exists in the combined circulatory system & pulmonary system when there is no blood motion. The value of MSP in animal experimental models is approximately 7\u00a0mm Hg. It is an indicator of how full the circulatory system is (i.e. the volume of blood in the system compared to the capacity of the system), and is influenced by the volume of circulating blood and the smooth muscle tone in the walls of the venous system (which determines the capacity of the system). MSP is measured in two ways experimentally, and as a result has two alternative naming conventions. MSFP is measured after clamping the aortic root and the great veins at point of entry to right atrium. On the other hand, MCFP is measured experimentally by briefly inducing cardiac arrest or naturally during cardiac arrest once the blood redistributes. It may also be estimated in vivo using a series of inspiratory holds when a patient is on a mechanical ventilator. It can be used to demonstrate effects of drugs on the venous tone while the circulating blood volume remains constant, or to measure haemodynamic changes during haemorrhage.","label":1},{"id":497,"text":"Alhadji Waziri Kolo Ibrahim was a Kanuri military general and politician who served as the Prime Minister of Kanem-Bornu from 1963 to 1967 and from 1978 to 1979.

Thracian rituals such as the Tryphon Zarezan which is dedicated to Saint Tryphon of Campsada, Kukeri and Martenitza are to this day kept alive in the modern Bulgarian culture. The oldest treasure of worked gold in the world, dating back to the 5th millennium BC, comes from the site of the Varna Necropolis.

It was first described in 2005 by psychologist Shane Frederick. The CRT has a moderate positive correlation with measures of intelligence, such as the Intelligence Quotient test, and it correlates highly with various measures of mental heuristics. Some research argue that the CRT is actually measuring cognitive abilities (colloquially known as intelligence). Later research showed that the CRT is a multifaceted construct: many start their response with the correct answer, while others fail to solve the test even if they reflect on their intuitive first answer. It has also been argued that suppression of the first answer is not the only factor behind the successful performance on the CRT: numeracy and reflectivity both account for performance.","label":1},{"id":578,"text":"Paul Nungesser says he was target of gender-based harassment campaign .

Ultralight backpacking can be done with a single backpack or as part of a multi-day backpacking trip. It is a popular form of backpacking for those seeking an extreme camping experience, as well as for thru-hikers and long-distance backpackers who seek to minimize their weight and pack size. Ultralight backpacking typically uses smaller tents, sleeping bags, cooking gear, and other essentials. Many ultralight backpacking trips can be completed with the same amount of gear as standard backpacking trips, but using significantly lighter weight items. This allows for greater mobility and flexibility in the wilderness, making it easier to travel over difficult terrain or to skirt around difficult weather conditions. While there are many different techniques and philosophies associated with ultralight backpacking, a few key principles are common to all forms of lightweight backpacking. These include: carrying only what is necessary, minimizing weight while still providing necessary function and comfort, choosing the right gear for the conditions, and being prepared for whatever might come along.

Nevertheless, there are several areas where federal common law continues to govern. The Swift doctrine Until 1938, federal courts in America followed the doctrine set forth in the 1842 case of Swift v. Tyson. In that case, the United States Supreme Court held that federal courts hearing cases brought under their diversity jurisdiction (allowing them to hear cases between parties from different U.S. states) had to apply the statutory law of the states, but not the common law developed by state courts.

In modern times, the most famous irrigation game is probably chess, which has been played for centuries across the world. Irrigation games are a particularly interesting form of cooperative game because players must work together to achieve common goals. Players must decide which crops to water, when to water them, and how much water to supply. Players also need to make strategic decisions about which crops to water, in order to maximize their crop yield. Irrigation games can be quite challenging. Players must coordinate their actions in order to achieve the best results. If players fail to cooperate, the game can quickly become chaotic and difficult to play. Despite their challenges, irrigation games are rewarding experiences. Players learn how to cooperate and make strategic decisions.

Pilots flying from Wold-Chamberlain Field, now Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, would use this field for practicing approaches. After the war, Grill sold the field and some adjoining land to American Aviation, Inc. John Stuber named the field \"Flying Cloud Airport\" to reflect local Indian lore and flying. The Metropolitan Airports Commission bought the airport in 1948 and paved the runway. The MAC built a control tower in 1963. By 1966, it was ranked the second-busiest airport in the central United States, behind Chicago-O'Hare International Airport. In 1968, with 446,198 takeoffs and landings, it was the ninth-busiest airport in the United States. Today it is designated by the FAA as a reliever airport and aircraft are restricted to or less, except in an emergency situation or when operated by the U.S. Government.","label":1},{"id":927,"text":"Single mother from Philadelphia is facing four counts of endangering welfare of a child .

It is most frequently extended to diplomats serving in foreign embassies and consulates, but can also be granted to diplomats serving in a host country's capital city. In some cases, diplomatic immunity may also cover staff of international organizations such as the United Nations. The doctrine of diplomatic immunity has been extended to cover personnel from private international organizations such as the Red Cross. While not formally protected by law, private international organizations often enjoy a degree of immunity from local jurisdiction in order to encourage their participation in humanitarian relief efforts.

By mounting this motor generator unit in the conventional location traditionally used for the standard automotive alternator, it permits a low-cost method of adding mild hybrid capabilities such as start-stop, power assist, and mild levels of regenerative braking. BAS differ from other mild hybrid systems as they are not run off the vehicle's crankshaft. Generation I BAS General Motors introduced a mild hybrid system called belt alternator starter (BAS) in the 2007 Saturn Vue Green Line. The BAS system is also used in the 2008\u20132009 Chevrolet Malibu Hybrid. It operates similarly to other mild hybrids with a start-stop system, in that it shuts down the engine as the vehicle comes to a stop and instantly restarts it when the brake pedal is released.","label":1},{"id":985,"text":"Robert Ayres Barnet (September 3, 1853 \u2013 March 3, 1915) was an American lawyer and politician who served as the 23rd Governor of New York from 1899 to 1903.

Rolls-Royce designed the engine and first ran it in 1933 as a private venture. Initially known as the PV-12, it was later called Merlin following the company convention of naming its four-stroke piston aero engines after birds of prey. After several modifications, the first production variants of the PV-12 were completed in 1936. The first operational aircraft to enter service using the Merlin were the Fairey Battle, Hawker Hurricane and Supermarine Spitfire. The Merlin remains most closely associated with the Spitfire and Hurricane, although the majority of the production run was for the four-engined Avro Lancaster heavy bomber. A series of rapidly-applied developments, brought about by wartime needs, markedly improved the engine's performance and durability. Starting at 1,000\u00a0hp for the first production models, most late war versions produced just under 1,800\u00a0hp, and the very latest version as used in the de Havilland Hornet over 2,000\u00a0hp.","label":1},{"id":1027,"text":"Amber Phillips of Los Angeles expressed her support for the right to die law introduced in California on Tuesday that if passed next year will legalize physician assisted suicide for terminally ill patients . ` The pain and suffering took some of her dignity away when she became so ill that she was not able to work , ' Phillips said of her mother who died in the summer of","label":0},{"id":1028,"text":"Vince Cable prides himself on being the Tories ` bogeyman in the Coalition Cabinet . ` I ' m regularly voted their least popular Cabinet member , ` he says .

Sprung is a video game for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. It was developed by French game developer Playlogic and published by Ubisoft. The game was released on December 14, 2018, for Microsoft Windows and macOS. The objective of Sprung is to guide a character through a series of obstacles in order to earn points and reach the end of the level. The character can jump, run, and swim; each action consumes energy which must be replenished by collecting energy pickups or by eating fruit which restores energy. The player can also use objects to help them navigate their way through the levels, such as ramps or swinging platforms. Levels are designed to be replayable, with different obstacles and layouts available on each playthrough. Sprung is based on the Parc Ast\u00e9rix amusement park in Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines, France. The game's development began in early 2017 after Ubisoft commissioned Playlogic to create a new IP for the company's PixARK video gaming platform. Playlogic aimed to create a fun and accessible platformer that would appeal to both children and adults, based on its own experiences playing video games as a child. The development team worked with park personnel to ensure accurate recreations of the amusement park's features and elements.

The center of Tegulus' cult is at Ivrea.  Veneration for Saint Tegulus actually arose at the end of the 10th century, when during the episcopate of Blessed Warmondus (Varmondo), the saint's relics were discovered in a sepulcher situated a short distance away from Ivrea. The relics were solemnly translated to the cathedral of Ivrea within the city walls, and placed in the chapel of San Giacomo. The relics were later translated, with those of Saint Bessus, to the chapel of Santissimo Sacramento.  According to local tradition, Tegulus survived the decimation of his Legion but was eventually beheaded on the road to Montaldo Dora, at the spot later occupied by the chapel of Santa Croce, which was built in the 14th century.

In some societies, same-sex relationships are considered immoral, while in others they are seen as natural and even necessary. Throughout the course of human history, there have been many notable people who have been in same-sex relationships, including philosophers, politicians, and artists. The origins of homosexuality are difficult to discern, as there is no single point at which it first began to be accepted as a sexual orientation. Some historians suggest that it may have arisen from the necessity for homosexual individuals to band together in order to protect themselves from violence or persecution. Others believe that it may have developed as a result of the repression and discrimination that homosexuals have faced throughout history. Regardless of its origins, homosexuality has always been a controversial subject. Many people view it as immoral, while others see it as a natural expression of love. Throughout history, same-sex relationships have been met with varying degrees of acceptance, ranging from total condemnation to legal recognition.

The type and only known species is Cretacladoides imperator, which was discovered by Argentine paleontologist Alejandro Kappelman and his colleagues in La Rioja Province, Argentina in 2011. The specimen consists of a partial skeleton including the skull, mandible, and spinal column. The describers assigned it to the Tyrannosauridae, and named it after the Latin word for \"emperor\", \"imperator\". Cretacladoides is a small tyrannosauroid, measuring at in length. The holotype specimen has a long snout and small eyes. The teeth are fused into a single jagged blade in the upper jaw, similar to those of other tyrannosauroids such as Tarbosaurus and Albertosaurus. The lower jaw is much more primitive, with smaller teeth that may have been used for feedings on vegetation. The skeleton is heavily damaged, hindering determination of many anatomical details. It is currently assumed that Cretacladoides was a herbivore, based on the large size of its teeth and the fact that other tyrannosauroids were also herbivores at this time. However, further study is needed to confirm this hypothesis.","label":0},{"id":1140,"text":"British officers were forced to accept four-day inspection from experts from Moscow.

In 1636 the adjacent city of Edinburgh bought the feudal superiority of the Canongate but it remained a semi-autonomous burgh under its own administration of bailies chosen by Edinburgh magistrates, until its formal incorporation into the city in 1856. The burgh gained its name from the route that the canons of Holyrood Abbey took to Edinburgh - the canons' way or the canons' gait, from the Scots word gait meaning \"way\".

Early in that period, Anatolia was divided into several Iron Age kingdoms, most notably Lydia in the west, Phrygia in the center and Urartu in the east.

In the aftermath of the Greco-Persian Wars, all of Anatolia remained under Persian control except for the Aegean coast, which was incorporated in the Delian League in the 470s BC. Alexander the Great finally wrested control of the whole region from Persia in the 330s BC. After Alexander's death, his conquests were split amongst several of his trusted generals, but were under constant threat of invasion from both the Gauls and other powerful rulers in Pergamon, Pontus, and Egypt. The Seleucid Empire, the largest of Alexander's territories, and which included Anatolia, became involved in a disastrous war with Rome culminating in the battles of Thermopylae and Magnesia. The resulting Treaty of Apamea in (188 BC) saw the Seleucids retreat from Anatolia. The Kingdom of Pergamum and the Republic of Rhodes, Rome's allies in the war, were granted the former Seleucid lands in Anatolia.

Monism is the philosophical position that attributes oneness or singleness to any entity or concept, including individual beings, objects, and ideas. This might be called \"unitary monism\" if it regards a single thing as the source of all existence or \"plural monism\" if it regards multiple things as being essentially equivalent. In both cases, the term \"monism\" is used pejoratively to suggest that the thinker in question poses thinking about entities and concepts in an insufficiently complex way. The history of the concept of monism is complex and has many different interpretations. One of the earliest recorded mentions of the idea comes from the 6th century BCE philosopher Parmenides, who argued that there is only one thing in the universe, which he named \"the One\". Parmenides's student Zeno of Elea also argued for monism, but in a more sophisticated way that has since been abandoned. Monism was popularised in the 3rd century BCE by Plato, who argued that there is only one kind of thing in the world: Forms. Forms are eternal and unchanging, and exist outside of time and space. Aristotle later refined Plato's idea by arguing that there are two types of monism: physical monism, which holds that there is only one kind of substance (e.g. soul, mind, matter), and logical monism, which holds","label":0},{"id":1160,"text":"The plane might have hit an object on the runway , the Japanese transportation ministry says . 23 people have minor injuries , officials say .

The model was first proposed by researchers at the University of Minnesota in the 1970s, and has been influential in the study of work and organizational behavior. The theory is based on the premise that organizations are dynamic systems that are constantly seeking to maintain a desired level of activity. This level of activity is typically determined by three factors: the level of customer demand, the amount of available resources, and the organization's ability to respond to customer demand. The theory is based on the assumption that individuals and groups regulate their behavior in order to maintain a desired level of activity within organizations. The model was first proposed by researchers at the University of Minnesota in the 1970s, and has been influential in the study of work and organizational behavior. The theory has been used to explain a wide range of phenomena, including employee motivation, performance management, team dynamics, communication patterns, and organizational change. It has also been used to develop a number of empirically based models for studying these phenomena. The theory has been criticized for its lack of empirical support, its reliance on static assumptions about the nature of organizations, and its failure to account for variation across organizations.

Whereas sociocultural development traces processes that tend to increase the complexity of a society or culture, sociocultural evolution also considers process that can lead to decreases in complexity (degeneration) or that can produce variation or proliferation without any seemingly significant changes in complexity (cladogenesis). Sociocultural evolution is \"the process by which structural reorganization is affected through time, eventually producing a form or structure which is qualitatively different from the ancestral form\". Most of the 19th-century and some 20th-century approaches to socioculture aimed to provide models for the evolution of humankind as a whole, arguing that different societies have reached different stages of social development. The most comprehensive attempt to develop a general theory of social evolution centering on the development of sociocultural systems, the work of Talcott Parsons (1902\u20131979), operated on a scale which included a theory of world history. Another attempt, on a less systematic scale, originated from the 1970s with the world-systems approach of Immanuel Wallerstein (1930-2019) and his followers.

The country has the third-largest hydroelectric capacity in the world, after China and Brazil. Although hydroelectricity was first developed in Turkey in the late 19th century, the country\u2019s modern hydroelectric industry began in the 1920s. At that time, the Turkish government commissioned a number of large hydroelectric projects, most notably the Southeastern Anatolian Project (G\u00f6lc\u00fck-K\u0131r\u0131kkale) and the Marmara-Brak Lake Project (\u00c7am-K\u00f6y\u00fc). Despite this early investment, hydroelectricity played a relatively limited role in Turkey\u2019s economy until the early 1960s. That year, however, a series of large dam projects\u2014the Keban Dam (Keban), the Akkuyu Dam (Akkuyu), and the Ilisu Dam (Ilisu)\u2014were completed, significantly enhancing hydroelectricity\u2019s role in Turkey\u2019s energy portfolio. Today, hydroelectricity provides more than half of Turkey\u2019s total electricity generation. The country\u2019s ongoing investment in hydroelectricity is reflected in its impressive installed capacity. As of 2017, Turkey had a total installed capacity of 37,692 megawatts (MW), ranking third in the world behind China and Brazil.

Xenocatabolism has been used for the treatment of environmental pollutants for over two decades. The first use of xenocatabolism in the treatment of environmental pollutants was in the 1980s when researchers discovered that the fungus Aspergillus niger can break down chemicals such as benzo(a)pyrene. Since then, xenocatabolism has been used to treat a variety of other environmental pollutants, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), heavy metals, and chemical warfare agents. Xenocatabolism is a unique approach to treating environmental pollutants because it uses natural products to degrade or neutralize chemical compounds. Unlike traditional bioremediation methods, which rely on artificial chemicals to break down environmental pollutants, xenocatabolism uses naturally occurring compounds to do the job. This is because natural products are more resistant to degradation by environmental bacteria and enzymes. Xenocatabolism is also advantageous because it is non-toxic and environmentally friendly. Unlike traditional bioremediation methods, which often produce hazardous byproducts, xenocatabolism uses benign chemicals that are easily disposed of. Additionally, xenocatabolism is fast and efficient, meaning it can quickly degrade large quantities of environmental contaminants. Despite its advantages, xenocatabolism has yet to be widely adopted because it is not always available","label":0},{"id":1292,"text":"In 84 days from November 2013 to January 2014, the area around Azle, Texas, shook with 27 magnitude two or greater earthquakes.

Disjunctivism is a position in the philosophy of language that states that there are no linguistic units that are independent of one another. The term was coined by the philosopher David Lewis in his book Philosophical Papers. Disjunctivism is opposed to unitarianism, which holds that there are linguistic units, such as words or phrases, that are independent of one another and can be separated into distinct parts or categories. Disjunctivists argue that there is no such thing as a linguistic unit that is separate from other linguistic units and can be analyzed in isolation from them. According to disjunctivism, all linguistic units are interconnected and form a network or web of relationships. This network of relationships is constantly changing and evolving, and it cannot be reduced or analyzed in any way without destroying its complexity and integrity. Disjunctivists believe that this network of relationships is what gives language its unique and special properties. Disjunctivism has been controversial since it was first introduced, and many philosophers have argued against it. Some say that disjunctivism is too radical a position and does not allow for enough analysis and understanding of language. Others argue that disjunctivism does not actually explain or explain well how the network of relationships in language works.","label":0},{"id":1310,"text":"The pioneering camera innovator clinched the title after being granted 4.5 million restricted stock units-valued at $ 284.5 million-at the end of the year .

It is measured in candelas per square metre (cd\/m\u00b2). It is a measure of the total energy radiated by a light source in the visible or near-visible spectrum. Luminous energy is important because it affects how well we can see in low light conditions. For example, it is important for night time drivers and pedestrians to be able to see obstacles in the road, and for people working in dark offices. The brightness of a light source is determined by the total energy radiated by the light source. This includes both radiant energy, which is what is radiated from the light source itself, and non-radiant energy, which comes from the heat that is produced by the radiation of the light. There are several ways to measure luminous energy. One way is to use a luminometer, which is a device that measures the brightness of a light source in candelas per square metre (cd\/m\u00b2). Another way is to use a photometer, which measures the brightness of a light source in terms of photons per square metre (ppm).","label":0},{"id":1468,"text":"Chad Hurst of Salt Lake City , Utah was sucker punched by a plane passenger when they landed in the city Sunday .

The offensive was intended to outflank and seize the German-occupied city of Caen, an important Allied objective, in the early stages of Operation Overlord, the Allied invasion of north-west Europe. Preceded by Operation Martlet to secure the right flank of the advance, Operation Epsom began early on 26 June, with units of the 15th (Scottish) Infantry Division advancing behind a rolling artillery barrage. Air cover was sporadic for much of the operation, because poor weather in England forced the last-minute cancellation of bomber support. Accompanied by the 31st Tank Brigade, the 15th (Scottish) Division made steady progress and by the end of the first day had overrun much of the German outpost line, although some difficulties remained in securing the flanks. In mutually-costly fighting over the following two days, a foothold was secured across the River Odon and efforts were made to expand this, by capturing tactically valuable points around the salient and moving up the 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division.

Schneirla was educated at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor (M.S., 1925; Sc.D., 1928), and joined the staff of New York University in 1928. He made the first of eight trips to the Barro Colorado Island, Panama Canal Zone, to study the behavior of army ants in 1932. His \u201cStudies on Army Ants in Panama,\u201d published the next year, provided new insight into their behavior. He discovered that these ants operate on a 36-day cycle consisting of a 16-day nomadic pattern followed by a 20-day stationary phase. In 1934 he reported that ants follow a particular pattern when moving into new territory and that raids by these insects peak once during the morning and again in the afternoon. Sudden changes in weather also were found to give rise to sudden bursts of activity. In 1944 he showed that their raids were caused by the level of excitability of the ant colony and not by a scarcity of prey.","label":1},{"id":1599,"text":"A magnitude-7.8 earthquake struck near Kathmandu , Nepal .

After his death in 1975, Spain transitioned into a democracy. During this time period Spain was officially known as the Spanish State . The nature of the regime evolved and changed during its existence. Months after the start of the Spanish Civil War in July 1936, Franco emerged as the dominant rebel military leader and was proclaimed head of state on 1 April 1939, ruling a dictatorship over the territory controlled by the Nationalist faction. The 1937 Unification Decree, which merged all parties supporting the rebel side, led to Nationalist Spain becoming a single-party regime under the FET y de las JONS. The end of the war in 1939 brought the extension of the Franco rule to the whole country and the exile of Republican institutions. The Francoist dictatorship originally took a form described as \"fascistized dictatorship\", or \"semi-fascist regime\", showing clear influence of fascism in fields such as labor relations, the autarkic economic policy, aesthetics, and the single-party system.

The municipal police are divided into two main categories: the uniformed patrol officers, who patrol on foot and in vehicles, and the forensic experts. The origins of municipal policing in Spain can be traced back to the early days of the country's modern history. In 1833, King Fernando VII created the Guardia Civil, a national police force that was exclusively composed of soldiers from the Spanish army. The municipal police were initially tasked with providing security for Spanish cities, but they gradually began to assume additional responsibilities, such as frontier policing and public order management. Municipal policing underwent a significant transformation in the late 20th century, when law enforcement agencies began to adopt a more proactive approach to crime prevention. This shift led to the development of specialized units such as the Policia Urbana (urban police), which are responsible for addressing crime problems in urban areas. Today, municipal policing plays an important role in protecting public safety in Spanish towns and cities.","label":0},{"id":1751,"text":"`` Furious 7 '' pays tribute to star Paul Walker , who died during filming .

It consists of a series of short questions and is designed to measure the ability to understand complex text. The Bloom test was developed in the late 1970s by Dr. Sandra Bloom and her colleagues at the University of California, Los Angeles. The Bloom test is currently the most commonly used adolescent reading comprehension test in the United States. The Bloom test is divided into three parts: the reading selection section, the reading comprehension section, and the writing section. The reading selection section consists of 20 questions that ask students to read a passage about a flower and answer questions about it. The reading comprehension section asks students to read a passage about a car and answer questions about it. The writing section asks students to write a essay about their favorite flower. The Bloom test has been shown to be a reliable measure of adolescent reading comprehension. It has been found to be sensitive to changes in student reading level and has been used to assess reading comprehension skills across diverse populations of students, including low-income students, minority students, and students with disabilities.","label":0},{"id":1758,"text":"Maurice Goldblatt (January 16, 1892 \u2013 July 29, 1986) was a French-born American rabbi, philosopher and sociologist who is considered one of the founders of modern sociology.

The song impacted radio on May 15, 2007. The song in its entirety was leaked on April 23 from a 91X podcast interview with Deryck Whibley. It was confirmed on Sum 41's official site that this would be the opening track for the album. The song was used in the EA Sports computer game Madden 08 and Sony's NBA 08. It is the band's first single since the departure of guitarist Dave Baksh. Overview \"Underclass Hero\" was written by Whibley with a theme of \"us against them\", similar to their previous lyrics. Although \"Underclass Hero\" is written from a different angle, the song refers prominently to society and the struggle of \"high-class versus the underclass\" instead of \"youth against adults\" as in All Killer No Filler. The song also uses the more classic punk-rock themes of anti-establishment. This is the theme song for MTV's Crash My School.

Linear codes are also called error-correcting codes, block codes, or convolutional codes. Linear codes are used in a variety of applications, such as data communication and storage, machine learning and decoding, computer security, and biomedical data analysis. Linear codes are also of particular interest to researchers working on quantum cryptography and secure communications. A linear code is a code that can be used to communicate errors between two parties. The two parties use a codebook to map each symbol in the code to a corresponding symbol in the other party's codebook. If one of the parties detects an error, they can use their codebook to find the correct symbol in the other party's codebook and send them the correct symbol. Linear codes are composed of codewords (strings of symbols). Each codeword is divided into blocks (groups of consecutive symbols). A block is broken down into symbols (individual symbols). A symbol is either a letter or a number. To encode a message using a linear code, you first choose a codeword for your message. You then create a codebook that contains all the possible symbols you could possibly use for that codeword. You then map each symbol in your message to a corresponding symbol in your codebook. Finally, you encode your message using the symbols in your codebook. To decode","label":0},{"id":1763,"text":"Lifting sanctions could pave the way for Iran to build atomic bomb .

It was moved to the genus Ptilotula after a molecular phylogenetic analysis, published in 2011, showed that Lichenostomus was polyphyletic. Description The grey-fronted honeyeater is a small, plain honeyeater with a yellow neck plume bordered above by black. It has a small grey patch at the forehead, that may be obscure in northern subspecies. The crown is olive yellow and the lores blackish. The upper parts are olive grey and flight feathers yellow olive. Underparts are off white with indistinct stripes.

The character was reprised in the 1990 film Return to Green Acres. CNN rated the character as being amongst \"The most stylish TV housewives of all time\". Character background Lisa (portrayed by actress Eva Gabor), a glamorous Hungarian immigrant, plays the role of the wife of Oliver Wendell Douglas, a successful New York City attorney who had long harbored the dream of moving to the Midwest and operating a farm. The leitmotif of the character through the years remains her comedic Hungarian accent, which leads to numerous jocular interactions with the Hooterville locals, who mishear Lisa's statements and are likewise misheard by Lisa. Both Lisa and Oliver are regularly portrayed as wearing city clothes, which seem misfit in the Hooterville expanse. Lisa's penchant for wearing resplendent jewelry, costly dresses and heeled footwear adds to this characterization through the seasons.","label":1},{"id":1916,"text":"floyd mayweather faces manny pacquiao in las vegas on may 2 . the bout is being billed as 'the fight of the century' mayweather holds an impressive undefeated professional boxing record .","label":0},{"id":1917,"text":"Captain Sabertooth (in Norwegian: Kaptein Sabeltann) is a Norwegian-American comic book character, created by writer and artist John Buscema and first appearing in Marvel Comics' The Avengers #55 (March 1985).

The unemployment rate for young people is twice the national average. Youth unemployment has been on the rise globally since the late 2000s and has reached crisis levels in many countries. There are several factors contributing to youth unemployment. Firstly, there is an increase in precarious employment, which often doesn't offer the same opportunities and benefits as regular, full-time jobs. Secondly, employers are often reluctant to hire young people because they believe they will not stay with the company for a long time. Thirdly, many young people do not have enough skills or education to find a job. Finally, there is a lack of vocational training and apprenticeship programmes available to young people. Youth unemployment is a major issue worldwide and there are many ways to combat it. Governments can invest in vocational training and apprenticeship programmes, create more secure employment opportunities, and provide support for young people during their job search. NGOs can also help to create awareness of the problem and provide resources for young people affected by it.","label":0},{"id":1949,"text":"denver police report nine arrests in wednesday's demonstrations . more than 60 people were arrested, a law enforcement source told cnn .","label":0},{"id":1950,"text":"Stranmillis is an area in south Belfast, Northern Ireland.

Comparison of parallel passages within the Bible is a major area of Biblical scholarship. The Bible frequently describes the same event from different points of view in different canonical books yielding a more complete picture of the event than a single passage on the subject does. Some of the biblical passages describe an area of biblical study in an up close context whereas other passages provide information on the bigger picture surrounding the subject at hand. The Bible also provides partial information on some subjects in a given passage then adds additional information in other biblical passages. The technique of comparing Scripture with Scripture is important for determining correct biblical doctrine.

Over seven days, mainly Sinhalese mobs attacked, burned, looted, and killed Tamil civilians. Estimates of the death toll range between 400 and 3,000, and 150,000 people became homeless. Around 8,000 homes and 5,000 shops were destroyed. The economic cost of the riots was estimated to be $300 million. The NGO International Commission of Jurists described the pogrom as a genocide in a report published in December 1983.","label":1},{"id":2075,"text":"Cardinal Francis George , a Chicago native , died Friday .

It contains a single species, Kongonaphon kely, which is known from a fragmentary partial skeleton. This fossil hails from the late Ladinian or early Carnian-age \"basal Isalo II beds\". As the first lagerpetid found in Africa, Kongonaphon extends the range of the family significantly. It possessed a combination of features from various other lagerpetids, but developed particularly long and slender leg bones. Kongonaphon is also the first lagerpetid for which fossils of the snout and teeth are known. It was likely an insectivore based on the shape and texture of its teeth. Kongonaphon is notable for its minuscule size, even compared to other small early avemetatarsalians. The proportionally elongated femur was only about 4\u00a0cm (1.6 inches) long, and the total height of the animal was estimated at around 10\u00a0cm (3.9 inches). Alongside other miniaturized archosaurs such as Scleromochlus, it suggests that avemetatarsalians experienced an abrupt reduction in size early in their evolution. This may explain the poor preservation and scarcity of early and middle Triassic avemetatarsalian fossils. A small size also may have helped them exploit a variety of new ecological niches. The most successful avemetatarsalian subgroups, pterosaurs and dinosaurs, may have evolved as a result of this abrupt size reduction. Miniaturization has been correlated with the evolution of flight (a defining feature of pterosaurs) and the acquisition of bipedalism (which was utilized by many dinosaurs). It would also lead to poor heat retention, encouraging the evolution of feathers or other filamentous structures.","label":1},{"id":2079,"text":"Ted Loveday led Gonville and Caius College , Cambridge to the University Challenge title this week .

Part-time jobs are mistakenly thought by some to not be careers. However, legislation exists to stop employers from discriminating against part-time workers so this should not be a factor when making decisions on career advancement.

The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) does not define full-time employment or part-time employment. This is a matter generally to be determined by the employer (US Department of Labor).

Some animals may have more than one form of sexual behaviour, and some may engage in sexual activities for reasons other than reproduction. Sexual behaviour can be a means of establishing or maintaining social relationships, competing for resources or mates, or satisfying individual desires. Animal sexual behaviour has been observed in a variety of species across the animal kingdom, from insects to large mammals. Some species display a great deal of sexual variation, with different populations of animals exhibiting differing levels of sexual activity. The study of animal sexual behaviour is an important tool for understanding the biology and evolution of sexuality, as well as the social dynamics of animal populations. It can also provide insights into human sexuality, since many animal behaviours are similar to those exhibited by humans.","label":0},{"id":2139,"text":"Craig V.

The theory proposes that large scale brain networks connect brain regions, including regions within frontal, parietal, temporal, and cingulate cortices, underlie the biological basis of human intelligence. These regions, which overlap significantly with the task-positive network, allow the brain to communicate and exchange information efficiently with one another. Support for this theory is primarily based on neuroimaging evidence, with support from lesion studies. The P-FIT is influential in that it explains the majority of current neuroimaging findings, as well as increasing empirical support for cognition being the result of large-scale brain networks, rather than numerous domain-specific processes or modules. A 2010 review of the neuroscience of intelligence described P-FIT as \"the best available answer to the question of where in the brain intelligence resides\". The theory General intelligence requires specific brain regions and incorporates: Sensory processing, primarily in the visual and auditory modalities, including specific temporal and parietal areas Sensory abstracting and elaboration by the parietal cortex (especially the supramarginal, superior parietal, and angular gyri) Interaction between the parietal cortex and frontal lobes for hypothesis testing available solutions Response selection and inhibition of competing responses by the anterior cingulate","label":1},{"id":2153,"text":"Jane Long was an English stage actor of the seventeenth century.

Mollwitz is best known for his sculptures and paintings of human beings and animals in emotionally charged situations. His paintings are characterized by their thick brushstrokes, low tones, and often starkly contrasting colors. His sculptures are often monumental and figure-based, depicting individual characters with great psychological depth.

Liabilities are measured at fair value and reported in the balance sheet. A liability may be classified according to its maturity date or the type of creditor to which it is owed. Long-term liabilities are those that will be settled in more than one year. Current liabilities are those that must be settled within one year. Short-term liabilities are those that will be settled within one month. Liabilities can also be classified according to the risk they pose to the financial entity. Financial entities may choose to classify liabilities into categories based on their level of risk. High-risk liabilities are those that pose a greater risk of not being paid, such as accounts receivable from customers who cannot or will not pay on time. Low-risk liabilities are those that pose a lower risk of not being paid, such as short-term debt. Financial entities must balance their liabilities against their assets to ensure that they have enough money available to pay all of their obligations when they fall due. If too much money is owed on the liabilities side of the ledger, the financial entity may need to borrow money from other lenders to meet its obligations. If too little money is available to cover the liabilities, the financial entity may have to sell assets or take out loans in order to raise cash.","label":0},{"id":2199,"text":"Joanne Kyger (November 19, 1934 \u2013 March 22, 2009) was an American stage, film and television actress.

Unlike other glutaredoxins, glutaredoxin 2 (Grx2) cannot reduce ribonucleotide reductase. Grx2 has significantly higher catalytic activity in the reduction of mixed disulphides with glutathione (GSH) compared with other glutaredoxins. The active site residues (Cys9-Pro10-Tyr11-Cys12, in Escherichia coli Grx2, which are found at the interface between the N- and C-terminal domains are identical to other glutaredoxins, but there is no other similarity between glutaredoxin 2 and other glutaredoxins. Grx2 is structurally similar to glutathione-S-transferases (GST), but there is no obvious sequence similarity. The inter-domain contacts are mainly hydrophobic, suggesting that the two domains are unlikely to be stable on their own. Both domains are needed for correct folding and activity of Grx2. It is thought that the primary function of Grx2 is to catalyse reversible glutathionylation of proteins with GSH in cellular redox regulation including the response to oxidative stress.

This description established the first step toward semiconductor quantum optics because the SLEs simultaneously includes the quantized light\u2013matter interaction and the Coulomb-interaction coupling among electronic excitations within a semiconductor. The SLEs are one of the most accurate methods to describe light emission in semiconductors and they are suited for a systematic modeling of semiconductor emission ranging from excitonic luminescence to lasers. Due to randomness of the vacuum-field fluctuations, semiconductor luminescence is incoherent whereas the extensions of the SLEs include the possibility to study resonance fluorescence resulting from optical pumping with coherent laser light. At this level, one is often interested to control and access higher-order photon-correlation effects, distinct many-body states, as well as light\u2013semiconductor entanglement.

Example An early case in which charges of judicial murder were raised was the Amboyna massacre in 1623, which caused a legal dispute between the English and Dutch governments over the conduct of a court in the Dutch East Indies that had ordered the execution of ten English men accused of treason. The dispute centered around differing interpretations of the legal jurisdiction of the court in question. The English believed that this court had not been competent to try and execute these EIC members, and so believed the executions to have been fundamentally illegal, thus constituting \"judicial murder\".

A second edition of the system (BC2) has been in ongoing development in Britain since 1977. Origins of the system Henry E. Bliss began working on the Bliss Classification system while working at the City College of New York Library as Assistant Librarian. He was a critic of Melvil Dewey's work with the Dewey Decimal System and believed that organization of titles needed to be done with an intellectual mind frame. Being overly pragmatic or simply alphabetical, would be inadequate. In fact, Bliss is the only theorist who created an organizational scheme based on societal needs. Bliss wanted a classification system that would provide distinct rules yet still be adaptable to whatever kind of collection a library might have, as different libraries have different needs. His solution was the concept of \"alternative location,\" in which a particular subject could be put in more than one place, as long as the library made a specific choice and used it consistently.","label":1},{"id":2296,"text":"Swiss Professor Jean-Pierre Wolf is pioneering the use of lasers to affect the weather .

There is no central authority in control of the religion and much diversity exists among practitioners, who are known as Vodouists, Vodouisants, or Serviteurs. Vodou revolves around spirits known as lwa. Typically deriving their names and attributes from traditional West and Central African divinities, they are equated with Roman Catholic saints. The lwa divide up into different groups, the nanchon (\"nations\"), most notably the Rada and the Petwo. Various myths and stories are told about these lwa, which are regarded as subservient to a transcendent creator deity, Bondye. This theology has been labelled both monotheistic and polytheistic. An initiatory tradition, Vodouists usually meet to venerate the lwa in an ounf\u00f2 (temple), run by an oungan (priest) or manbo (priestess). A central ritual involves practitioners drumming, singing, and dancing to encourage a lwa to possess one of their members and thus communicate with them. Offerings to the lwa include fruit, liquor, and sacrificed animals. Offerings are also given to the spirits of the dead. Several forms of divination are utilized to decipher messages from the lwa.

From 2004 to 2006 the \"total production volume for clothing decreased by about 5% each year... [and by] 2006 the European union trade deficit for clothing was at 33.7 billion.\" These statistics show that while there are benefits of their advanced design legislation, the economic and external factors still hindered their industry growth in ways the U.S. can empathize with. As 2007 came to a close, WIPO, or the World Intellectual Property Organization, had registered twenty-nine international designs.","label":1},{"id":2321,"text":"New video shows stag do strutting in denim hotpants and heels .

Chloride channel accessory 3 (CLCA3) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the CLCA3 gene. CLCA3 is a chloride channel accessory protein that functions in the body to control chloride ions fluxes through cell membranes. This protein is also known as the \"calcium-release channel accessory 3\" or \"calcium-release channel auxiliary 3\". CLCA3 belongs to the family of proteins that are known as chloride channel accessory proteins. These proteins are responsible for controlling the flux of chloride ions through cell membranes. The function of CLCA3 is to allow calcium ions to pass through the cell membrane and into the cytoplasm. This allows cells to regulate their calcium levels and perform other important functions. CLCA3 is located on the outer surface of the plasma membrane and interacts with other proteins that are involved in regulating chloride fluxes through cell membranes. This interaction allows CLCA3 to function properly and control calcium levels in cells. CLCA3 is expressed in various tissues throughout the body, including the brain, heart, and kidney. The role of CLCA3 in these tissues is not well understood, but it may play a role in regulating calcium levels or performing other important tasks.

The Fulbe Empire The Fuladu kingdom was founded, born of rebellion led by Mussa Moloh\u2019s father, Moloh Eggue, also known as Alfa Moloh, against the Mandinka who formerly ruled the Gambia region. Those Mandingo rulers who once owned the land now the Fulbe state remained inside the kingdom once belonging to them.

It is not a musical form, but rather a technique. The term continued to be used down to modern times with changing senses, at first for polyphony in general, then to differentiate a subcategory of polyphony (either in contrast to organum, or for improvised as distinct from written polyphony). By extension it became the name of a part that is added above the tenor, and later as the name of the highest part in a polyphonic setting (the equivalent of \"cantus\", \"superius\", and \"soprano\").

European-American settlers first arrived in the area in 1851, and farming and logging were soon major industries. The construction of the Klamath Dam in 1968 resulted in the destruction of many tributaries of the Smith River, leading to a decline in its salmon populations.

In essence, it means the practice of engaging in a Personal Securities Transaction in advance of a transaction in the same security for a client's account. Front running is considered a form of market manipulation in many markets. Cases typically involve individual brokers or brokerage firms trading stock in and out of undisclosed, unmonitored accounts of relatives or confederates. Institutional and individual investors may also commit a front running violation when they are privy to inside information. A front running firm either buys for its own account before filling customer buy orders that drive up the price, or sells for its own account before filling customer sell orders that drive down the price. Front running is prohibited since the front-runner profits from nonpublic information, at the expense of its own customers, the block trade, or the public market. In 2003, several hedge fund and mutual fund companies became embroiled in an illegal late trading scandal made public by a complaint against Bank of America brought by New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer.

Casuistry can be used to justify any decision, even if the legal principle underlying it is invalid. Casuists may also use casuistry to deceive their opponents or clients. Casuistry is a key feature of the medieval judicial process, which was based on the principle of \"lex talionis\" or \"an eye for an eye\". This meant that people were expected to take revenge for wrongs done to them. As a result, casuistry developed as a way of justifying decisions based on this principle without actually doing anything. For example, if someone had been hurt by another person, the casuist might try to argue that the other person should be punished in exactly the same way. This was known as \"strict liability\". In more recent times, casuistry has been used more often to deceive people. For example, a lawyer might argue that a particular law is unconstitutional in order to get their client off the hook. Casuistry can also be used to justify unjustified actions by authorities. For example, during the Nazi concentration camps, Nazis often used casuistry to argue that prisoners were being punished for crimes they hadn't committed.","label":0},{"id":2469,"text":"Research by wildlife charity the WWF identified 11 ` deforestation fronts ' where 80 per cent of projected global forest losses could occur by 2030 .

However, the term also refers to the product of this type of research, which of course normally takes a textual form. As a result, ethnography is also sometimes seen as a genre of writing, one used to describe patterns of human social interaction in particular contexts. Within the context of ethnography, the term 'realism' is often used to refer to the assumptions that some kinds of ethnographic work make about the phenomena to be investigated, and how these are to be understood. However, 'ethnographic realism' has also been used to refer to a style of writing that narrates the author's experiences and observations as if the reader were witnessing or experiencing events first hand. A work written using ethnographic realism may be referred to as a realist ethnography, and classified as a subgenre of ethnography.","label":1},{"id":2480,"text":"Anarchism in Japan began to emerge in the late 19th century, with the first anarchist group formed in 1887.

Centennial Building is located on the north side of Lake Street in the Loop district of Chicago, Illinois. It was designed by the architectural firm of Holabird & Root and built in 1922 as the headquarters of the I.O.O.F., one of the largest fraternal organizations in the United States. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. The I.O.O.F.'s initial investment in the building was $100,000, and it paid off quickly; within a year, membership had increased from 2,000 to 8,000 members. The building's success led to an increase in membership and donations, and by 1925, the organization had outgrown its original building and purchased a site on North Clark Street for a new headquarters. Construction on the new building began in 1926 and was completed three years later; it cost $1 million dollars and was even more impressive than its predecessor, featuring a columned atrium with a fountain in its center and marble floors and walls throughout. Since 1983, the I.O.O.F.'s Centennial Building has served as the headquarters of the IBO (International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers), which moved into the building in 1984 after purchasing it from the I.O.O.F.; today, it is one of Chicago's most important labor unions.","label":0},{"id":2530,"text":"Ernest Hilbert (born 1970) is an American mathematician and philosopher who has made significant contributions to mathematics, logic, and philosophy.

The system is based on the finishing times of the cyclists in a race, with the first cyclist across the line receiving a ranking of 1, the second cyclist 2 etc., up to the cyclist who finishes last, who receives a ranking of 10. The GC was first introduced in 1903 by Jules Durand, and was originally a system for determining the order of cyclists in a race. The system was based on the number of minutes that each cyclist had been leading at the end of the race. However, this system was not very accurate, and it was not until 1912 that the GC was changed to its current form. The GC is one of the most important rankings in cycling, and is often used to determine which riders will be selected for major races. For example, if there is a major race that has a number of riders who are qualified for qualification based on their GC ranking, then the riders who are ranked first through fourth will be selected for qualification.","label":0},{"id":2575,"text":"Charles Henry Douglass (February 1870\u20131940) was a leading businessman in Georgia State in his time and continues to be remembered today for his contributions to the African American community through his historical Douglass Theatre.

The cave was known by the Osage Indians in the early 16th century, after a tribe member fell through the cave's main entrance, a sinkhole. There is evidence that in 1541 the Spanish explored the cave, but the first recorded expedition was in 1869, led by Henry T. Blow. The unofficial Stone County chapter of Bald Knobbers, a local group of vigilantes, were rumored to have taken people to the top of Roark Mountain, and thrown them in the sink hole. Marvel Cave was originally called Marble Cave, after explorers in 1882 saw what they thought was marble on the cave's ceiling. This started the Marble Cave Mining Company, although later it was realized that there was never any marble in the cave. The Marble Cave Mining Company ceased all operations after only four and a half years. William Lynch purchased the cave in 1889, and soon after opened the cave to the public. In 1950, Hugo Herschend leased the cave for 99 years. The Herschends made renovations to the cave, and later opened a theme park, Silver Dollar City, on the surface above the cave. Marvel Cave is known for being one of the largest caves in Missouri, having one of the largest cave entry rooms (the Cathedral Room) of any cave in North America, and for being one of the longest running tourist attractions in the Ozarks.","label":1},{"id":2732,"text":"Robin Rinaldi, 42, met her husband Scott, 48, in 1999.

It had been embedded in the wall of Dalrymple Creek, which had been scoured out by heavy rain. In 1896 the skull was sent to Sydney where it was examined by the trustees of the Australian Museum. The museum was interested in purchasing the fossil but could not agree on an acceptable price. Eventually the skull was returned to its owner. It remained at the homestead until 1914 when Professor Edgeworth David, Professor of Archaeology at Sydney University visited Talgai and presented a theory that the skull was 20,000 years old and provided a \"missing link\" in the evolutionary chain. This sudden change in attitude towards the skull was motivated in part by the recent \"discovery\" of the Piltdown man fossils in England.

Domenico di Zanobi's paintings were first grouped together in 1966 by the American art historian Everett Fahy, who recognized about two dozen paintings in a similar style. Since none of these paintings are signed, Fahy named their artist the \"Master of the Johnson Nativity,\" after the panel of the Nativity in the Johnson Collection at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. In 1996, the Florentine scholar Annamaria Bernacchioni identified this artist as Domenico di Zanobi, a documented assistant of Filippo Lippi in Florence and Prato, based on her discovery of the carpenter's bill for the Coronation of the Virgin at the Museo della Misericordia in San Miniato. This painting, attributed by Fahy to the Master of the Johnson Nativity, was reportedly commissioned by the Chellini family in 1476 from a painter named \"Domenico.\" Since the painting is clearly not by Domenico di Michelino, who also worked for the Chellini family, Bernacchioni suggest that it's by Domenico di Zanobi, who shared a workshop with Domenico di Michelino in Florence's Via delle Terme by 1467.

The barony was one of the smallest, with four knight's fiefs attached to it. The first baron was G.

It typically involves many full-time organizers, who work by building up confidence and strong networks and leaders within the workforce, and by confrontational campaigns involving large numbers of union members. The organizing model is strongly linked to social movement unionism and community unionism. The organizing model contributes to the discussion of how trade unions can reverse the trend of declining membership, which they are experiencing in most industrial nations, and how they can recapture some of the political power, which the labor movement has lost over the past century. The organizing model is frequently compared and contrasted with other methods of union organization, such as the servicing model. There is disagreement as to the logistics of applying the organizing model and whether it should focus on organizing existing members, recruiting new members, or both. The prominence of the model and the debate over its worth are seen primarily in the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom.","label":1},{"id":2927,"text":"Kyler Bruce Fackrell (born November 25, 1991) is an American football outside linebacker for the Los Angeles Chargers of the National Football League (NFL).

It is thus based on the concept of figure\u2013ground from Gestalt psychology. For example, in a street map with strong figure-ground contrast, the reader would be able to isolate and focus attention on individual features, like a given street, park, or lake, as well as layers of related features, like the street network. Strong figure-ground contrast has been seen as a desirable goal of map design, because it helps the map reader to perceive distinct geographic phenomena in the map. This allows more complex composition techniques such as visual hierarchy to organize these phenomena into clear structures that help readers use the map for its intended purposes.","label":1},{"id":2938,"text":"The Egyptian-themed mansion , advertised online as Pharaoh 's Palace , promises a ` perfect private location ' on seven secluded acres in Tampa .

In general, green personality types are independent thinkers, gold personality types are pragmatic planners, orange personality types are very action-oriented, and blue personality types are very people-oriented. The idea behind True Colors is that it does not pigeonhole people into one personality type over another with the understanding that one's personality might make adjustments based on his or her environment or associations. True Colors is a way to understand the behaviors and motivations of others relative to our own personalities to help mitigate potential conflict by learning to recognize personality differences and characteristics.","label":1},{"id":2949,"text":"Atletico Madrid beat Real Madrid 1-0 at the Vicente Calderon on Tuesday .

His entire career was spent imposing party discipline through the Central Control Commission of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

He joined the Bolshevik faction of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party in 1906, and worked in the illegal party organisation in Moscow, Rostov-on-Don and Tula. He was arrested repeatedly, but avoided being deported to Siberia or held in prison for very long. There is no evidence that these arrests were for political activity.

First, the teacher prepares a text that contains examples of the grammatical form to be studied. The teacher reads the text to the students at normal speed while they take notes. Students then work in small groups to prepare a summary of their work using the correct grammatical structures, and finally each group presents their work to the rest of the class. Dictogloss activities encourage learners to focus on the form of their language while also being based in communication, and are used in task-based language teaching. Dictogloss activities have several advantages. They integrate the four language skills of listening, reading, speaking, and writing. They also give students opportunities to talk about both content and the language itself. Furthermore, dictogloss activities are a useful way of presenting new factual information to students and encourage them to listen for key points. Finally, they give support to less confident students, as they are encouraged to participate in their groups as part of the structure of the activity.","label":1},{"id":3117,"text":"The UK general election is just over two weeks away .

He then went on to study at the University of Cambridge, where he earned his Master of Arts degree in 1931 and his Doctor of Philosophy degree in 1934. Kaldor began his career as a lecturer at the London School of Economics (LSE) in 1935. He was appointed Professor of Economics at LSE in 1958, a post he held until his retirement in 1972.

It is the application and study of insect and other arthropod biology to criminal matters. It also involves the application of the study of arthropods, including insects, arachnids, centipedes, millipedes, and crustaceans to criminal or legal cases. It is primarily associated with death investigations; however, it may also be used to detect drugs and poisons, determine the location of an incident, and find the presence and time of the infliction of wounds. Forensic entomology can be divided into three subfields: urban, stored-product and medico-legal\/medico-criminal entomology. History Historically, there have been several accounts of applications for, and experimentation with, forensic entomology. The concept of forensic entomology dates back to at least the 13th century. However, only in the last 30 years has forensic entomology been systematically explored as a feasible source for evidence in criminal investigations. Through their own experiments and interest in arthropods and death, Sung Tzu, Francesco Redi, Bergeret d\u2019Arbois, Jean Pierre M\u00e9gnin and the physiologist Hermann Reinhard have helped to lay the foundations for today's modern forensic entomology.","label":1},{"id":3168,"text":"Three teenage boys from north-west London detained in Turkey last month .

The main science goals are to understand (A) how and where tidal heat is generated inside Io, (B) how tidal heat is transported to the surface, and (C) how Io is evolving. These results are expected to have direct implications for the thermal history of Europa and Ganymede as well as provide insights into other tidally heated worlds such as Titan and Enceladus. The IVO data may also improve our understanding of magma oceans and thus the early evolution of the Earth and Moon. IVO is similar to the Io Orbiter concept suggested for the New Frontiers Program by the 2013\u20132022 U. S. National Research Council Planetary Science Decadal Survey.

It is a progressive myopathy that results in muscle weakness and wasting, and can ultimately lead to death. FRDA is caused by a mutation in the FMR1 gene, which is located on the long arm of chromosome 2. The FMR1 gene produces a protein called frataxin. Frataxin is responsible for controlling the amount of muscle protein (muscle fiber) in cells. A mutation in the FMR1 gene causes an overproduction of frataxin, which leads to muscle weakness and wasting. There is no cure for FRDA, but there are treatments available that can help improve symptoms. Treatment options include medication, physical therapy, and surgery.

The note coincided with the detonation of the Tsar Bomba, the most powerful nuclear test in history, and followed close on the heels of the Berlin Crisis and Bay of Pigs Invasion.

During the next ten years, a community grew around Williams Ranch consisting of a number of homes, a hotel, a general store, a school and a number of other businesses including a stage stop. A post office operated in Williams Ranch from 1877 to 1892. The reason the town died was out of greed, because the railroad was going to go through there, but the people raised the price of their lands to high, so the railroad bypassed Williams Ranch, Texas. Outlaw John Wesley Hardin met Deputy Sheriff Charles Webb in Williams Ranch about a month before Hardin killed Webb. By the 1880s, the community had about 250 residents. Its demise began when it was bypassed by the Santa Fe Railroad in 1885 but more for the reason of the feud that existed between the town's original settlers and its newcomers.","label":1},{"id":3435,"text":"Jack Wilshere was joined by former England manager Glenn Hoddle .

IPS systems are used in commercial and residential environments to provide location information for applications such as real-time mapping, indoor navigation, and social networking. IPS systems use two primary methods to determine a user's location: triangulation and time of flight (ToF). Triangulation uses the geometrical properties of walls and objects in the environment to calculate a user's position. ToF uses the time it takes for a radio wave to travel between two points and calculate a user's distance. IPS systems can be divided into three categories based on how they collect location data: peer-to-peer, client-server, and centralized. Peer-to-peer IPS systems use multiple users' devices to share location data. Client-server IPS systems use one device to collect and store all the location data. Centralized IPS systems use a server to collect and store all the location data. IPS systems are commonly used in commercial buildings, such as airports, hospitals, shopping malls, and schools.

The site lies some north of the major center of Tikal. The name is sometimes spelled as Waxaktun. History of discovery With recent achievements in the decipherment of the ancient Maya hieroglyphic writing system, it has been determined that the ancient name for this site translates roughly as Siaan K'aan or \"Born in Heaven\". The name Uaxactun was given to the site by its rediscoverer, archaeologist Sylvanus Morley, in May 1916. He coined the name from Maya words Waxac and Tun, to mean \"Eight Stones\". The name has two meanings; Morley's stated reason for the name was to commemorate it as the first site where an inscription dating from the 8th Bakt\u00fan of the Maya calendar was discovered (making it then the earliest known Maya date). The other meaning is a pun, since \"Uaxactun\" sounds like \"Washington\", the U.S. capital and home of the Carnegie Institute which funded Morley's explorations.","label":1},{"id":3660,"text":"Lib Dem leader warns three or four-party coalition ` is not going to work ' Raises prospect of Lib Dems entering government with Labour or Tories .

According to another version of the story, the situation was quite the reverse: Segovia commissioned the work with the stipulation that there should be no cadenza and the work be titled Fantasia concertante. Villa-Lobos, however, ignored these demands, supplying an extended cadenza and insisting the work be called a concerto. The concerto was first performed on 6 February 1956 in Houston, Texas, by Andr\u00e9s Segovia and the Houston Symphony Orchestra, conducted by the composer.

This effect can be anything from convincing a reluctant listener that something is true, to asserting one's own power.

In 1327 he was solicitor of the episcopal court at Basle, and shortly after, while clerk to Bishop Berthold von Buchecke, held a similar position in Strasbourg.

The term charter covers a range of written legal documentation, including diplomas, writs and wills. A diploma was a royal charter that granted rights over land or other privileges by the king, whereas a writ was an instruction (or prohibition) by the king which may have contained evidence of rights or privileges. Diplomas were usually written on parchment in Latin, but often contained sections in the vernacular, describing the bounds of estates, which often correspond closely to modern parish boundaries. The writ was authenticated by a seal and gradually replaced the diploma as evidence of land tenure during the late Anglo-Saxon and early Norman periods.

For more than 150 years, the Comanche were the dominant native tribe in the region, known as \u201cthe Lords of the Southern Plains\u201d, though they also shared parts of Comancheria with the Wichita, Kiowa, and Kiowa Apache and, after 1840, the southern Cheyenne and Arapaho. The value of the Comanche traditional homeland was recognized by European-American colonists seeking to settle the American frontier and quickly brought the two sides into conflict. The Comanche Wars began in 1706 with raids by Comanche warriors on the Spanish colonies of New Spain and continued until the last bands of Comanche surrendered to the United States Army in 1875, although a few Comanche continued to fight in later conflicts such as the Buffalo Hunters' War in 1876 and 1877.

Fundamental analysis is one of the five main financial analysis methods. It is also one of the six investment analysis methods. There are several goals of fundamental analysis: to identify undervalued stocks, to identify companies with strong fundamentals, to find bargains in stocks, and to identify companies with weak fundamentals. The fundamental analysis process involves examining a company's financial statements and trends to gain an understanding of its underlying business. The most important part of a company's financial statement is its income statement. The income statement tells you how much money a company made in total during a given period of time (e.g., the past quarter). The other important part of a company's financial statement is its balance sheet. The balance sheet shows you how much money a company has in total at any given moment (e.g., at the end of the past quarter).

According to the 2011 census, there are around 10,000 Turkish citizens living in Norway, most of them living in Oslo. The first Turks to arrive in Norway were traders and merchants who came to Norway during the late Middle Ages. The first recorded Turkish immigrant to arrive in Norway was S\u00fcleyman \u00c7elebi, a merchant from the Ottoman Empire who settled in Bergen in 1525. Others followed suit and by the end of the 16th century, there were around 50 Turkish immigrants living in Norway. The early Turkish immigrants were mainly traders and merchants, but over time they started to settle down and start families. The first Turkish-born Norwegian was Cevdet Bey, who was born in 1871 in present-day Turkey and arrived in Norway as a child with his family. The early Turkish immigrants encountered some resistance from the Norwegian population, who viewed them as foreigners. However, over time the Norwegian Turks began to assimilate into Norwegian society and have established themselves as a distinct community within Norwegian society. Today, the largest concentration of Turkish citizens living in Norway is found in Oslo, where they make up around 10% of the city's population. There are also a number of small communities located throughout Norway, most notably in Bergen, Trondheim, and Stavanger. Turkish culture has had a significant impact on Norwegian culture over the years","label":0},{"id":3991,"text":"April is National Get Tested Month in the U.S. John Sutter : Some argue that this freedom to test is the path to a healthier society .
