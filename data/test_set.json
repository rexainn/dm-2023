Neocteniza trapdoors are unique among North American spiders because they use their armored carapace not just for protection from predators, but also for trapping air and moisture inside the spider's burrow. This allows the spiders to survive in dry environments where other species would not be able to survive."},{"id":56,"text":"Nicola Horlick , 54 , whoraised six children while working in the City .

Until he reached maturity (then defined as his 13th birthday) on 15 February 1723, the kingdom was ruled by Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans, as Regent of France. Cardinal Fleury was chief minister from 1726 until his death in 1743, at which time the king took sole control of the kingdom.

In 1748, Louis returned the Austrian Netherlands, won at the Battle of Fontenoy of 1745. He ceded New France in North America to Great Britain and Spain at the conclusion of the disastrous Seven Years' War in 1763. He incorporated the territories of the Duchy of Lorraine and the Corsican Republic into the Kingdom of France.

It encompasses both the objective and subjective aspects of art, and examines the principles which govern its production, appreciation, and interpretation. For centuries, art has been used to communicate messages and evoke feelings in those who view it. Whether it is a painting, sculpture, or piece of music, art can evoke a range of powerful emotions in its viewers. While there is no one right way to experience art, most aestheticians believe that it is important to explore different perspectives and look for beauty in all forms. Aesthetics has been a central concern of artists and philosophers for centuries, and there is still much to be learned about how art affects our emotions and how we experience beauty. While many debates remain unresolved, aesthetic theory has provided us with valuable insights into how we perceive the world around us."},{"id":109,"text":"Each year thousands of homeless dogs facing euthanasia get loaded on planes and flown to new homes in places where shelters are experiencing shortages .

It is the movement of cells from their birthplace, the cell division zone, towards their final destination. Cell migration is a critical process in the development of cells. Cells migrate in order to find new places to divide and grow, and to find new surfaces on which to attach themselves. Migration can also help cells find new sources of nutrients and oxygen. Cells can migrate in a number of different ways, depending on the type of cell and the location where it is located. Migration can be subdivided into two main categories: direct migration and indirect migration. Direct migration involves the movement of cells directly from one location to another. Indirect migration happens when cells move between different areas within a same organism or between different organisms. Direct migration involves the movement of cells from one location to another. Direct migration can be subdivided into two main categories: chemotaxis and motility. Chemotaxis occurs when cells use chemicals to direct their movement; motility occurs when cells move by using physical forces, such as muscle contractions or waves.

This designation was given by the Nazi regime, as a way of distinguishing between the \"Aryan\" or \"Nordic\" porcelain made for general consumption and the \"Jewish\" porcelain specifically intended for Jewish use. The Judenporzellan industry began in 18th century Europe, as a result of the large number of Jews who migrated to that continent from Spain and Portugal. In 1740, a Jewish potter in Vienna named Abraham Goldschmidt received a patent for his improved pottery kiln. The success of his business led to the establishment of similar kilns in other European cities, and the production of Judenporzellan began to grow. During the Nazi era, the manufacture and sale of Judenporzellan was subject to strict government control. All potters were required to join the Reich Chamber of Ceramics, and to produce only porcelain intended for Jewish use. This policy was implemented in order to reduce competition between Jewish potters and reduce the supply of inferior quality porcelain available to non-Jewish consumers. Despite these efforts, much Judenporzellan was produced outside of government control, and there is evidence that some non-Jewish consumers were able to purchase Judenporzellan products.

Greatly enlarged in the 17th century, it remains a private house. It is a Grade II* listed building. History Cadw notes the \"eccentric\" relationship\" of the two wings of the house and suggests this is evidence that the house was reconstructed from earlier buildings, probably a 14th century manor house. The architectural historian John Newman notes the \"historically\" important existence of a raised cruck truss in the hall of the house which he suggests places it as a transitional building between the traditional, single-level, Welsh hall house and later, storeyed, buildings. What stands today represents two construction periods of the late 16th and early 17th centuries, with some 19th century reconstruction.

The track width derives from a scale of 1:160 for rails. Background When N gauge was developed it proved impossible to fit the then available motors into scale models of British prototype locomotives. British railways use a smaller loading gauge than those in Europe and America, resulting in smaller locomotives. A greater body size was required on the models to accommodate the motors, so instead of adopting the correct 1:160 scale, 1:148 was used. This allows larger models, but means that the gauge is not an accurate representation of standard gauge. A similar problem and solution was adopted with OO gauge and British TT gauge in Britain. However, since N scales to gauge, it is less out of scale than OO or TT3 in representing the standard gauge."},{"id":445,"text":"prince harry will tonight fly out of the uk to australia without seeing new niece or nephew . the duchess of cambridge is now overdue for the birth of her second child . harry will not be able to meet the new royal baby until he returns to this country in mid may ."},{"id":446,"text":"Franz Beckenbauer believes Jurgen Klopp could succeed Pep Guardiola at Bayern Munich.

According to these criteria, estimates of the number of mestizos in Mexico vary from about 40 percent of the population to nearly all (including White Mexicans) who do not belong to the country's indigenous minorities. The meaning of the word mestizo has changed with time; it was originally used in the colonial era to refer to individuals who had half-Spanish and half-Amerindian ancestry. Although the caste system and racial classification were officially abandoned when Mexico became independent, the label mestizo was still used in academic circles to refer to people of mixed race. A mestizo ideology was created (exemplified by the Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos essay La raza c\u00f3smica) that mestizos are the result of racial mixing, and all Mexico must become mestizo so the country could achieve prosperity. After the Mexican Revolution, the government adopted and promoted the mestizo ideology to create a unified Mexican identity with no racial distinctions. By 1930, racial identities other than \"indigenous\" disappeared from the Mexican census. All Mexicans who did not speak indigenous languages (including European Mexicans) were now considered mestizo, transforming a racial identity into a national one."},{"id":521,"text":"Ralph Davis Brown II (born September 16, 1978) is a former American college and professional football player who was a cornerback in the National Football League (NFL) for ten seasons.

Thwala, born and raised in KwaMashu, began his year-long rape and murder spree in 1996 in South Africa's KwaZulu-Natal province. His modus operandi was to lure local women into accompanying him through the sugarcane fields of Mount Edgecombe near the town of Phoenix with the promise of employment as domestic servants in nearby hotels. Once they were deep within the cane fields, Thwala would attack the women, bind them with their own undergarments and then rape, strangle and bludgeon them to death. He relied on physical evidence of his attacks being destroyed through the common farming practice of burning cane fields, which set the police investigation back until a body was eventually discovered that had not yet been burned."},{"id":537,"text":"Thursday 's match between two baseball heavyweights turned into a brawl .

John was born in the region of Judea circa 7 BC to Zechariah and Elizabeth. When he was about eighteen years old, John began to preach repentance and forgiveness in the desert of Judea. After many years of preaching, John was arrested by the Jewish authorities on charges of sedition. When he was brought before them, they asked him whether he was the Christ. John answered \"I am not\" (John 1:21). Nevertheless, because of his preaching, John was executed by hanging on a cross at the orders of Pontius Pilate in AD 30. John's death has been seen as a turning point in history; it marked the beginning of Jesus' public ministry, and it initiated a new era in which Christianity became increasingly popular.

He is best known for his celebrated poetry, including \"The Canonization of John Donne\", \"Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard\", and \"The Trinity\". Donne was born in London to a family of modest means, the son of a lace-maker. His early education was at a local school before being sent to the University of Cambridge, where he studied law. Donne entered the Church of England in 1592 and began his career as a priest. He soon developed a reputation for his sermons and poetry, becoming one of the most popular clerics in England. In 1612, Donne became Dean of St Paul's Cathedral and soon began to receive major commissions for poems, including one for a funeral sermon for Queen Elizabeth I. Donne's death from an unknown illness at the age of 48 greatly affected his reputation. However, subsequent criticism has largely been dismissed by scholars, who continue to admire his work.

It was first described by Jos\u00e9 Bonaparte in 1854, and contains one species, Gargantuavis antirrhopus. Gargantuavis is distinguished from other members of its family by its large size and robust build. It reached a length of twelve meters and a weight of two hundred fifty kilograms, making it the largest known ornithopod species. It had a long tail and a large head with a prominent beak. The two horns on its head were also very large. Gargantuavis is known from only a single specimen, which was collected in the Villa de Leyva Formation in southern Argentina. Gargantuavis is one of the few Late Cretaceous ornithopods known from substantial remains, making it an important species for understanding the evolution and anatomy of these animals. Its classification as an Ornithopoda is based on features such as its teeth and horns, which are not found in other members of its family. Gargantuavis is currently the largest known ornithopod dinosaur and has been used to support theories about gigantism in this group of dinosaurs."},{"id":595,"text":"The Apple Watch is officially going on sale today-but none of its stores will have them in stock .

This method of submission is becoming more common as journals become more aware of the benefits of electronic submissions, such as speed and convenience. Electronic submission has many benefits that make it an attractive option for authors. One major advantage is that electronic submissions are often faster than traditional submissions methods, such as postal mail. This can be especially important for journals that require fast turnaround times for publication. Another advantage of electronic submissions is that they are often more convenient for authors. For example, authors no longer have to wait long periods of time to receive a rejection letter in response to a submission. In addition, some journals now allow authors to submit their manuscripts electronically and have them automatically converted to PDF format so that they can be easily shared with other members of the editorial team. Despite these advantages, there are some potential drawbacks to submitting manuscripts electronically. One potential problem is that some journals may not accept electronic submissions yet, so authors may have to wait longer than usual for their manuscript to be accepted. Another potential problem is that some automated systems used to convert manuscripts into PDF format may result in errors.

More specifically, the \"salutogenic model\" was originally concerned with the relationship between health, stress, and coping through a study of holocaust survivors. Despite going through the dramatic tragedy of the holocaust, some survivors were able to thrive later in life. The discovery that there must be powerful health causing factors led to the development of salutogenesis. The term was coined by Aaron Antonovsky, a professor of medical sociology. The salutogenic question posed by Aaron Antonovsky is, \"How can this person be helped to move toward greater health?\" Antonovsky's theories reject the \"traditional medical-model dichotomy separating health and illness\".

It may be accompanied by a strong sense of dread, anxiety or terror. The word \"thalassophobia\" was first used in English in 1892. It comes from the ancient Greek words \"thalassa\" meaning \"sea\" and \"phobos\" meaning \"fear\". The term has been used in a psychological sense since the late 19th century. The fear may be based on actual experiences or on imagined ones. It is often diagnosed in people who have been traumatized by a sea voyage or who have had a traumatic experience at sea. Thalassophobia may lead to avoidance of water, even if it is not deep, and to panic attacks on exposure to water. It may also cause an inability to tolerate being wet, leading to problems such as extreme discomfort during showers or baths, or even swimming. In some cases, it may lead to agoraphobia, a fear of open spaces."},{"id":639,"text":"The map was created using data from Nasa 's Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission satellite , and the Orbview-1 \/ Microlab satellite .

The present structure was built onto and around a log cabin (1797). The structure was built on the highest point in Sparta and used initially as a fort. Beneath the crawlspace of the present house, the original structure of the log foundation is still in place. The Rossiter-Little House was probably built about 1798 when Timothy Wells Rossiter, a Revolutionary War surgeon from Connecticut, bought the northeast corner lot at Broad and Miles Streets or the year after that when he bought the adjoining lot to the east. It is a contributing property of the Sparta Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. It is also part of the Historic American Buildings Survey. The main part of the house is built on a classic New England saltbox design typical of the 17th and 18th centuries. Dr. Rossiter displays his ancestral ties by building a house in a form distinct to that region. This style of house became used infrequently at the close of the eighteenth century for large home construction as the more popular Georgian and Federal styles were used throughout the region and may offer an insight into the house design he had been familiar with (or lived in) prior to emigrating to Georgia from Connecticut."},{"id":666,"text":"Social media is a key part of modelling agency's marketing strategy.

Case from a mine on the southern side of the Pamlico River near Aurora, North Carolina, the holotype is a right lower third of a femur of an egg-laying female. The denseness of the medullary bone indicated this last fact as it is a feature of living egg-laying female pelicans. The features of the femur allowed it to be classified as a pelican, but quite different from living species. Some foot bones (phalanges) have also been found.

The Vi\u1ec7t Minh was founded in 1930 in the Soviet Union as the Indochinese Communist Party (ICP), by Vietnamese emigrants who had fled to the Soviet Union during the French colonial period. The ICP was a branch of the Communist International, and its members were dedicated to overthrowing French colonial rule in Vietnam and unifying all of Southeast Asia under communist rule. Vi\u1ec7t Minh forces first emerged in 1930 as a paramilitary group called the Youth League for the Liberation of Vietnam (Youth League for Independence). In 1940, they merged with other anti-French organizations to form the Revolutionary Front of National Liberation (RFNL). After World War II, the Vi\u1ec7t Minh opposed both French re-establishment as well as American plans for a trusteeship over Southeast Asia. In 1946, Vi\u1ec7t Minh leader Ho Chi Minh proclaimed the independence of North Vietnam, which became known as the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV).

A legal reference book designed to be used with a pocket part subscription comes in the form of a sturdy hardcover book with a large pocket built into the back cover. At regular intervals (usually annually), the publisher sends out a new pocket part, which is a saddle-stapled pamphlet printed on cheap newsprint. The part comes with a thick card stapled or glued to one cover, and that card is inserted into the pocket to hold the pocket part inside the book which it updates. A pocket part is cumulative, meaning that it includes all updates to the book between the original date of publication of the book and the date of publication of the pocket part.

Etymology The word Hindustan generally refers to the Republic of India since 1947. It is conventionally believed to be derived from the Old Persian word Hindu, which in turn is derived from Sindhu, the Sanskrit name for the Indus River. Old Persian refers to the people living beyond the Indus as Hindu\u0161. This combined with the Avestan suffix -st\u0101n (cognate to Sanskrit \"sth\u0101n\", both meaning \"place\") results in Hindustan, as the land on the other side (from Persia) of the Indus.

Catholics were not the only group of religious minorities to suffer from persecution in Norway during this time, but they were the most severely affected. Anti-Catholicism in Norway can be traced back to the early Middle Ages, when the Norwegian kingdom was divided between a Christian north and a pagan south. The north was Christian, while the south was pagan. This division led to tension between the two groups, with Catholics in the south feeling marginalized and persecuted. In 1214, King H\u00e5kon IV of Norway passed a law prohibiting Christians from living in the south. This law led to a series of riots and expulsions of Catholics from the south, culminating in a mass exodus in 1252. For the next 250 years, Catholics were not allowed to live in Norway except for a few remote areas. The expulsion of Catholics from Norway began to change in the late Middle Ages. In 1397, King Magnus VI of Sweden attacked Norway and captured Oslo. Magnus forced H\u00e5kon IV to sign a treaty granting Sweden full sovereignty over Norway. One of the terms of this treaty was that Christians must leave Norway within three years or face exile. As a result of this treaty, Catholics were expelled from Norway beginning in 1398. The process was slow and brutal; many Catholics were killed or forced into exile. The last Catholic to leave Norway was Friar Odalrikus in"},{"id":735,"text":"Roseworthy is a small town in South Australia, about 10\u00a0km north of Gawler on the Horrocks Highway.

As a two-year-old in 1971 he won seven of his eleven races including the Brocklesby Stakes, July Stakes, Prix d'Arenberg, Cornwallis Stakes and Prix du Petit Couvert. In the following year he took time to reproduce his best form but emerged as the best sprinter in Europe with decisive wins in the Nunthorpe Stakes, Prix de l'Abbaye. Timeform rated Deep Diver the best racehorse of his generation in Europe at both two and three years of age. He has been retrospectively rated as one of the best British-trained sprinters of the 20th century. Deep Diver stood as a breeding stallion in Ireland, Australia and Japan but had little success as a sire of winners. Background Deep Diver was a strongly-built chestnut horse with a narrow white stripe bred at the Victor Stud in County Tipperary by George Harris. His sire, Gulf Pearl, won the Imperial Stakes in 1964 and the Chester Vase in 1965: he also sired the Coronation Cup winner Sea Chimes.

Tracking generally northwestward, the storm intensified while passing over the eastern Caroline Islands on September 17. Phanfone attained typhoon status on September 18 while located about 155 km (97 mi) east-northeast of Yap. That day, infrared data from the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) showed an eye surrounded by intense convection. On September 19, Phanfone reached its peak intensity with winds of 160 km\/h (100 mph) and a minimum pressure of 921 hPa (27.05 inHg). Shortly thereafter, the typhoon began to weaken as it approached Guam; however, it regained typhoon intensity as it passed south of the island chain on September 20. By September 21, Phanfone had weakened to a Category 1 storm and made landfall on Luzon early the next day. After crossing into the South China Sea, Phanfone began to lose strength; however, it regained some strength before making landfall on Vietnam late on September 22.

These funds are typically established by states to accumulate capital and provide a source of stable investment income for the government. Permanent funds are a relatively recent development in the history of government-owned investment funds. The first permanent fund was established in 1784 by the state of North Carolina. Permanent funds have become increasingly popular in recent years, as governments have become increasingly wary of the volatile nature of stock and bond markets. The principal advantage of permanent funds is that they are relatively stable sources of investment income. This is particularly important for governments, which typically have limited resources available for other types of investments. Permanent funds also offer a degree of diversification, as they can invest in a wide variety of securities. There are several disadvantages to permanent funds. First, they are typically quite conservative in their investment policies, which can lead to low returns over time. Second, they are typically not as liquid as other types of investments, which can make them difficult to sell at desired prices. Finally, permanent funds are not immune to market fluctuations, which can lead to significant losses if the market goes down."},{"id":769,"text":"Grass tried in his literature to come to grips with World War II and the Nazi era .

It describes a force observed on an asymmetric capacitor when high voltage is applied to the capacitor's electrodes. Once suitably charged up to high DC potentials, a thrust at the negative terminal, pushing it away from the positive terminal, is generated. The effect was named by inventor Thomas Townsend Brown who claimed that he did a series of experiments with professor of astronomy Paul Alfred Biefeld, a former teacher of Brown whom Brown claimed was his mentor and co-experimenter at Denison University in Ohio. The use of an asymmetric capacitor, with the negative electrode being larger than the positive electrode, allowed for more thrust to be produced in the direction from the low-flux to the high-flux region compared to a conventional capacitor. These asymmetric capacitors became known as Asymmetrical Capacitor Thrusters (ACT). The Biefeld\u2013Brown effect can be observed in ionocrafts and lifters, which utilize the effect to produce thrust in the air without requiring any combustion or moving parts."},{"id":787,"text":"Debris landed on Paula Viccica 's property in West Pittston , Pennsylvania .

The character was portrayed by Glenn Quinn. Doyle is a seer who receives prophetic visions from The Powers That Be, usually of people in peril. Half-human, half-demon, his demon heritage allows him to manage them without suffering any permanent damage. His half-Brachen demon physiology grants him the ability to shift from normal human to demonic appearance, in which he has heightened sense of smell and superior strength, speed, stamina, and dexterity, the last of which allows him to twist his head around in such a manner as to fake a broken neck. However, Doyle rarely used his Brachen powers, preferring to remain human, thus limiting his usefulness in a fight. Character history Doyle is an Irishman who was born to a human mother and a Brachen demon father. Doyle never knew his father or anyone on that side of his family, and his own demonic genes didn't physically manifest themselves until he was 21 years old. At that time, Doyle was a third grade teacher and a soup kitchen volunteer married to a woman named Harriet. He didn't take the news of his demonic heritage very well. In spite of Harriet's acceptance of his other side, his marriage ultimately disintegrated.

Skee-Ball has been featured in several films, including \"The Incredibles\" and \"Porky's\". Skee-Ball is an arcade game that uses small metal balls instead of golf balls to play. Players use a hand-held pole to hit the balls into a small target at the center of the playing field. The object of the game is to score as many points as possible before the opponent does. Points are scored by hitting the ball into either of two adjacent targets. Hitting one target scores four points, while hitting both targets scores ten points. If the player misses the ball completely, it goes out of play and they start over at the beginning of their turn. Skee-Ball was invented by Clarence Skee in 1887.

Prior to the development of macromolecular theory by Hermann Staudinger in the 1920s, which stated that individual polymers are composed of chains of covalently bonded monomers, association theory remained the most prevalent model of polymer structure in the scientific community. Importantly, although polymers consist of long chains of covalently linked molecules, the individual polymer chains can often still associate and undergo phase transitions and phase separation to form colloids, liquid crystals, solid crystals, or aggregates.

History Nicholson was laid down on 20 February 1976 by the Ingalls Shipbuilding, in Pascagoula, Miss.; launched on 11 November 1977; and commissioned on 12 May 1979. She first deployed on 18 November 1980. Nicholson deployed to the Persian Gulf in 1983 and returned to Charleston SC via the Suez Canal with a refueling stop in Djibouti. The crew enjoyed a port visit to Barcelona, Spain on the way back to home port. The ship encountered heavy seas on the voyage west across the Atlantic and experienced a casualty to the sonar dome. The dome was subsequently repaired in conjunction with a scheduled maintenance period at the Brooklyn Navy Shipyard between May 1984 and Feb 1985. Following the maintenance period the ship returned to Charleston, SC and began work ups for the next deployment including, Combat Systems Ship Qualification Trials, an Anti-Submarine warfare exercise in the Caribbean and Refresher Training in Guantanamo Bay Cuba. Nicholson was deployed for six months, in February 1990, with USS Dahlgren, as part of the Mid-East Force in the Persian Gulf. The deployment was fairly routine except for two incidents. The first was a pair of armed Iranian F-4s that overflew the ship in the Straits of Hormuz, and the second was that Nicholson and Dahlgren left the Persian Gulf for home just a week before Iraq invaded Kuwait."},{"id":1066,"text":"Mirador is a historic home located near Greenwood, Albemarle County, Virginia.

Backspin results when the ball is hit with the leading side of the racquet face (the side closest to the player's body) turned slightly towards the ground. This causes the ball to rotate around its vertical axis, giving it a rotational motion that is in the opposite direction of its forward motion. Backspin has several effects on a ball's trajectory. First, it causes the ball to move backwards more quickly than if it was hit with no spin. This increased backward speed makes it difficult for an opponent to hit the ball past or near the player. Second, backspin causes the ball to curve more than other types of spin, which makes it harder for an opponent to predict where it will go. Finally, backspin gives the ball more height when hit, which can make it easier to reach high shots or off-center balls."},{"id":1095,"text":"The American Legion Auxiliary (ALA) is a separate entity from the American Legion that share the same values.

Engagement can be measured in a variety of ways, but the most common way to measure student engagement is by using the Engagement Index developed by the National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE). The NSSE is a national survey that asks students about their experiences in college and how engaged they are in their learning. Student engagement has been shown to have a positive impact on student outcomes such as graduation rates and retention rates. A study by the National Collegiate Athletic Association found that \"higher levels of student engagement are associated with better academic outcomes for men and women... Higher levels of student engagement also lead to increased levels of satisfaction with college life, lower levels of stress, and increased persistence in pursuing a degree\" (Berkner, Simon, & Smith, p. 54). In addition, student engagement has been shown to be beneficial for both faculty and administration. Faculty members who are engaged in their work are more likely to be satisfied with their jobs and have higher levels of satisfaction with their teaching. In addition, administrators who are engaged in their work are more likely to have higher levels of morale among their staff and to be more effective in managing their institutions.

APIs are sets of requirements that govern how one application can communicate and interact with another. APIs can also allow developers to access certain internal functions of a program, although this is not typically the case for web APIs. In the simplest terms, an API allows one piece of software to interact with another piece of software, whether within a single computer via a mechanism provided by the operating system or over an internal or external TCP\/IP-based or non-TCP\/IP-based network. Currently, many APIs are provided by organizations for access with HTTP. APIs may be used by both developers inside the organisation that published the API or by any developers outside that organisation who wish to register for access to the interface. Characteristics Open APIs have three main characteristics: They are available for use by developers and other users with relatively few restrictions. Restrictions might include the necessity to register with the service providing the API. They are typically backed by open data. Open data is freely available for everyone to use and republish as they wish, without restrictions from copyright, patents or other mechanisms of control.

It is the remnant of an old fracture zone, and not a tectonic spreading center ridge (see mid-ocean ridge). It extends from the eastern end of the Clipperton Fracture Zone northeastward toward Mexico into Chiapas and El Chich\u00f3n until it is subducted into the Middle America Trench. It lies within the tectonic Cocos Plate, separating the lower and older seafloor of the Guatemala Basin which lies southeast of the ridge from higher and younger seafloor which lies to its northwest. Current research indicates that the ridge was formed as a fracture zone and transform fault along the East Pacific Rise. As a result of a change in the motion of the Pacific Plate about 13 million years ago, there was also a change in the orientation of the East Pacific Rise, which in turn reoriented the fracture zone, creating the current alignment that is today's Clipperton Fracture Zone. The Tehuantepec Ridge preserves the previous orientation."},{"id":1296,"text":"An MD\u2013MS program is a dual degree graduate school program awarding both a Doctor of Medicine (MD) and a Master of Science (MS) degree.

Unlike other jurisdictions, Chak\u00e1n did not seem to have a centralized government or control of a dominant Halach Uinik, as in the case of the provinces Ceh Pech or Ah Kin Chel. This is inferred from the fact that upon the Spaniards' arrival, Francisco de Montejo (el Mozo) was well received by some local leaders (batabob), but not others, such as Ah Kin Chuy, who organized resistance in the region's eastern towns to repel Spanish settlers. The most important city in the jurisdiction may have been Caucel, which controlled the region's salt trade since this material came from Chuburn\u00e1 and Sisal.

This process can be important for regulating gene expression, and has been implicated in a variety of processes, including DNA methylation, chromatin remodeling, and gene silencing. Histone methyltransferases are widely distributed across eukaryotic organisms and can be found in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. They are usually located in close proximity to DNA replication complexes, suggesting that they may play a role in regulating gene expression. However, the precise mechanism by which histone methyltransferases regulate gene expression is still unclear. Histone methyltransferases are composed of two domains: an N-terminal domain that contains the catalytic domain, and a C-terminal domain that contains various associated proteins. The N-terminal domain is composed of two \u03b1-helices, while the C-terminal domain is composed of two \u03b2-sheets. The \u03b1-helices form a platform that is embedded in the N-terminal domain, while the \u03b2-sheets form a structure that contacts the catalytic domain. Histone methyltransferases use two different mechanisms to transfer a methyl group from one histone to another. First, some histone methyltransferases use an ATP-dependent mechanism to transfer a methyl group from an ATP molecule to an histone.

The songs on the album were written during a series of road trips in 1975 and 1976, and reflect events that occurred during those trips, including several romantic relationships she had at the time. Characterized by lyrically dense, sprawling songs, as well as the overdubbed fretless bass playing of Jaco Pastorius (whom Mitchell had just met), Hejira continued the musician's journey beyond her pop records towards the freer, jazz-inspired music she would implement on later recordings. Some of the songs were written while Mitchell traveled as a member of Bob Dylan's Rolling Thunder Revue tour, and she performed the album tracks \"Coyote\" and \"Furry Sings the Blues\" with The Band at their final concert (later released as Martin Scorsese's The Last Waltz). The album did not sell as well as its predecessors, peaking at No. 22 in her native Canada. It reached No. 13 on the Billboard 200 pop album chart in the United States, where it was certified gold by the RIAA, and No. 11 in the UK, where it attained a silver certification.

The goal of attachment is for the child to feel safe and secure, and to form strong emotional bonds with the caregiver. Attachment in children is influenced by a variety of factors, including genetics and early experiences. Some children are more likely to form attachments than others, and may require special attention or care to elicit a strong response. Attachment can be disrupted in a variety of ways, including abuse, neglect, or separation from the caregiver. If left unaddressed, attachment disruptions can lead to a range of problems, including anxiety, depression, and behavioral issues. There is no one answer to how to promote attachment in children. However, interventions that focus on addressing childhood trauma are often effective at promoting healthy attachments. Additionally, caregivers can make a positive impact on their child's development by providing support and engaging in regular interactions."},{"id":1416,"text":"Gloucester beat Exeter 30-19 to book their place in the Challenge Cup final .

More than 180 court cairns have been found around Stonehenge and its vicinity, making it one of the most popular archaeological sites in England.

Diagnostic overshadowing occurs when a healthcare professional assumes that a patient's complaint is due to their disability or coexisting mental health condition rather than fully exploring the cause of the patient's symptoms. Often, once a patient has a confirmed diagnosis, there is a tendency to attribute all new behaviors or symptoms to the original diagnosis.  Diagnostic overshadowing increases the risk of further health complications and delay in accurate treatment. An example of diagnostic overshadowing may be a patient being diagnosed with a psychiatric problem and prescribed medication due to head banging behavior, but the patient actually has communication challenges and can't express pain in their mouth due to a dental abscess. History The term was first used to describe the underdiagnosis of mental illness in people with intellectual or developmental disabilities. In recent years, the term has also been used when physical illnesses are overlooked in people with mental illness."},{"id":1488,"text":"\"Billion Lights\" is a song by British boy band JLS.

Symptoms are uncommon at birth and shortly thereafter, but later in the first year of life there is often the onset of an increased work of breathing and failure to gain weight at a normal rate. With time, an uncorrected PDA usually leads to pulmonary hypertension followed by right-sided heart failure. The ductus arteriosus is a fetal blood vessel that normally closes soon after birth. In a PDA, the vessel does not close, but remains patent (open), resulting in an abnormal transmission of blood from the aorta to the pulmonary artery. PDA is common in newborns with persistent respiratory problems such as hypoxia, and has a high occurrence in premature newborns. Premature newborns are more likely to be hypoxic and have PDA due to underdevelopment of the heart and lungs."},{"id":1502,"text":"Stephan Lichtsteiner played alongside Eden Hazard at Lille in France .

The Ambedkar cartoon has been the subject of several protests and lawsuits over the years. In 2006, the Indian National Congress (INC) filed a lawsuit against Outlook magazine for its alleged offensive content in the Ambedkar cartoon. The case was eventually dismissed by the High Court of Delhi in 2009, with the INC alleging that the cartoon was an intentional insult to Ambedkar's memory.

Koevoet was active during the South African Border War between 1979 and 1989, during which it carried out hundreds of search and destroy operations against the People's Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN). Koevoet's methods were controversial, and the unit was accused of committing numerous atrocities against civilians. Over the course of the war, it killed or captured 3,225 insurgents and participated in 1,615 individual engagements.

TDR is a legal mechanism offered in some local government jurisdictions as a form of development control.

Franklinton is bordered by the Scioto River on the north and east, Harmon Avenue on the east, Stimmel Road and Greenlawn Avenue on the south, and Interstate 70 on the west. Its main thoroughfare is West Broad Street, one of the city's two main roads. A portion of the neighborhood is sometimes called The Bottoms because much of the land is subject to flooding from the Scioto and Olentangy rivers, and a floodwall is required to contain the rivers and protect the area from floods. The low-lying bottom land was well suited for farming, with the river serving as a direct connection to the Ohio River. The floodwall, completed in 2004, spurred developments in East Franklinton. The projects involved demolition of three public housing projects, displacing its former residents to other areas. The developments are predominantly luxury mixed-use buildings, spurring significant gentrification in the neighborhood."},{"id":1706,"text":"Former Prime Minister said he had ` decades ' still in him and joked that he would ` turn to drink ' if he ever stepped down from his multitude of global roles .

Positive symptoms are features that are not present in healthy individuals but appear as a result of the disease process. These include visual and\/or auditory hallucinations, delusions, paranoia, and major thought disorders. Negative symptoms refer to features that are normally present but are reduced or absent as a result of the disease process, including social withdrawal, apathy, anhedonia, alogia, and behavioral perseveration. Cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia involve disturbances in executive functions, working memory impairment, and inability to sustain attention. Given the high numbers of individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia (nearly 1% of modern-day populations), it is unlikely that the disorder has arisen solely from random mutations.

The program's core philosophy is that autistic people can participate in authentic emotional relationships if they are exposed to them in a gradual, systematic way. The goal of treatment is to systematically build up the motivation and tools for successfully interacting in social relationships, to correct deficits in this area that are thought to be common to all autistic people. RDI focuses on cultivating the building blocks of social connection\u2014such as referencing, emotion sharing, coregulation, and experience sharing\u2014that normally develop in infancy and early childhood. RDI is a family-based program, where trained consultants support families to alter their interaction and communication styles. There is a period of parent education, followed by an assessment of both the child and the child-parent relationship. After that consultants support the family through a set of specific objectives to build a \"guided participation\" relationship between parents and child that will allow the child to once again become a \"cognitive apprentice\" to the parents. Once the cognitive apprenticeship is in place, the family can move on to specific cognitive remediation objectives for the child.

Untranslatability can be caused by the meaning of a text or speech being unique to its original language, or by the rules of grammar and syntax being different between languages. It can also be due to cultural factors, such as idioms or expressions that are specific to a certain region or culture. Untranslatability can be a hindrance to international communication, especially if one language is more common than the others in a given area. It can also be a barrier to understanding literature and other works of art, since they may be difficult to understand even if they are translated. There is no one definitive measure of untranslatability, since it depends on the specific context in which a text or speech is used. However, some common indicators include the difficulty of translating specific words or phrases, the amount of source material that needs to be consulted for a complete translation, and the length of the text or speech."},{"id":2062,"text":"Xavier Denamur claims most dishes in French bistro are n't made on site .

It refers to the ability of religious organizations to integrate into and mobilise social networks, and to transmit values and norms. Religious capital can be positive, such as facilitating charitable giving, or negative, such as contributing to religious conservatism or conflict. Religious capital can also be increased through the process of socialisation, whereby individuals are exposed to and learn about religion. Religion has long been seen as a source of social cohesion and moral authority. As such, religious institutions have been able to mobilise support and resources from their members and supporters, which has helped them to achieve durable and influential positions in society. Religious capital is often associated with the Protestant ethic, which emphasises individual responsibility and self-reliance. Other forms of religious capital, such as Catholic social teaching or Islamic traditionalism, may also be beneficial in terms of social cohesion and moral authority."},{"id":2122,"text":"U.S. President Obama , Cuban President Raul Castro meet in Panama City .

It is perhaps the group's most popular live album, because Lotus did not receive a U.S. domestic release until 1991. It displays a mix between the fusion of Latin and blues-rock styles of the late 1960s and early 1970s, and the much more experimental and spiritual jazz fusion sound that characterized the band's mid-1970s work. The live material was recorded during the supporting tour for the Amigos album. A cover version of the Zombies' mid-1960s hit song \"She's Not There\" was released as a single and peaked at #27.

It is a form of investigative journalism which involves reading very selectively and quickly, in order to extract the most important and relevant information. Hot reading can be used when investigating any topic or target, but is particularly useful when investigating people or organizations who may be reluctant to talk to journalists or who have something they want to hide. By reading quickly and selectively, journalists can extract key information that will help them to understand their subject better. Hot reading is not without its risks, however. By reading too quickly or selectively, journalists may miss important clues or information that could lead them down the wrong path. Additionally, by focusing on key information rather than the entire story, journalists may miss important details that could later prove important. Despite these risks, hot reading is an essential tool for journalists who want to get the most out of their investigations. By taking the time to read carefully and selectively, journalists can build a more complete picture of their target and ultimately produce more accurate stories."},{"id":2242,"text":"Easterwood Airport (, Easterwood Field) is the regional airport for Texas A&M University, Bryan-College Station and Brazos County, Texas.

It is one of the most important Neolithic sites in the region, and has been described as one of the most significant archaeological discoveries of the last decade. The Bir Abu Matar site was first discovered in 2001 by a team of Egyptian and Swiss experts while excavating a site known as Tell el-Mutesellim. The site was initially thought to date back to the Early Dynastic Period, but further excavations revealed that it was occupied during the Neolithic period, around 4500 BC. The discovery of evidence for early agriculture and animal husbandry at Bir Abu Matar has made it one of the most significant archaeological finds of recent years. The site is located on a promontory overlooking the Nile Valley, and features settlements dating back to the Neolithic period. The buildings at Bir Abu Matar are made from mud-brick and stone, and are decorated with elaborate carvings. The site has also yielded evidence for early practices such as tattooing and scarring, which have been used to differentiate between social groups. The discovery of Bir Abu Matar has helped to redefine understanding of the Neolithic period in eastern Africa, and has led to renewed interest in ancient cultures in that region.

He studied in both the UK and France, at the Architectural Association School of Architecture and the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts, and returned to work as an architect after serving in the First World War. He rose to prominence in the 1930s, featuring in a book by architectural critic Trystan Edwards and winning the commission in 1932 to design Walthamstow Town Hall, which was eventually completed in 1942. Another civic building of this period was Wiltshire County Hall at Trowbridge. He also designed a handful of private houses, including Pemberley, in Loughton, 1936. He lived in Zoffany House in Strand-on-the-Green, Chiswick, London, from 1936. During the Second World War, he was appointed one of the Principal Architects of the Imperial War Graves Commission (now the Commonwealth War Graves Commission). In this post-war stage of his career, he designed several war memorials and numerous cemeteries for the British war dead. Examples of his Commission work are found in France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany. His work was said to have followed the style of that of two of his predecessors as Commission architects, Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker. Hepworth, who died in 1963, was described in his obituary as an architect of \"great speed and brilliance\" and \"sensitivity and eccentricity\", influenced by \"classical, English and local Norman styles\".

Regarded by some paleontologists as a distinct monophyletic group and by others as an adaptive grade within the basal mosasauroids, recent molecular and morphological data suggests that they are the oldest known members of the lineage leading to the mosasaurs. The family is recognized as containing two species, normally classified into two genera; Aigialosaurus and Opetiosaurus. When used as an adaptive grade rather than as an actual monophyletic group, many other basal mosasauroids of uncertain affinities are occasionally referred to as \"aigialosaurs\", such as the genera Komensaurus, Haasiasaurus, Carsosaurus and Dallasaurus and even entire mosasaur clades, such as the Tethysaurinae.

Masculinizing hormone therapy is generally used to increase masculinity in transgender people, though it can also be used to change other physical characteristics that are considered gender-nonconforming or non-masculine. It is not typically used to alter a person's sex characteristics, which are determined by their chromosomes and anatomy. Masculinizing hormone therapy is controversial and has been met with resistance from many transgender people and their advocates. Some believe that it can cause harm to transgender people and lead to undesired physical changes, while others believe that it can help trans people achieve a more masculine appearance and feel more comfortable in their own skin. There is no single approach to masculinizing hormone therapy, and each person's situation is unique. Some people choose to take hormones alone, while others combine hormones with other treatments such as surgery or psychotherapy. There is no single answer for how long masculinizing hormone therapy should last, and each person's treatment plan should be based on their individual needs and goals."},{"id":2541,"text":"alex oxlade-chamberlain and gary cahill take on jack nowell and george ford . england rugby stars take part in crossbar challenge on st george's day . arsenal winger oxlade-chamberlain impressed the football stars ."},{"id":2542,"text":"Arun Bhardwaj (born 24 February 1969) is an ultramarathon runner from New Delhi, India.

The pieces are usually movable and can be placed on the board either as individual units or as groups. This allows for a high degree of tactical flexibility in game play. Block wargames are a relatively recent development in the world of board wargames. The first block wargame was War in the Pacific 1944, which was published in 1994 by GMT Games. Since then, many other block wargames have been published, including the popular game Steamroller from Avalon Hill. The popularity of block wargames has led to a number of variants of the original game format. Some games, like War in the Pacific 1944, use blocks to represent entire armies, while others, like Steamroller, use blocks to represent only specific unit types. Block wargames are typically very complex and difficult to play. This complexity is due not only to the use of blocks as unit representations, but also to the fact that block wargames are often designed to allow for a high degree of tactical flexibility in game play.

Since 2007, vinyl records have enjoyed renewed popularity in the West and in East Asia. The analogue format made of polyvinyl chloride had been the main vehicle for the commercial distribution of pop music from the 1950s until the 1980s and 1990s when it was largely replaced by the compact disc (CD). Since the turn of the millennium, CDs have been partially replaced by digital downloads and streaming services. However, in 2007, vinyl sales made a sudden small increase, starting its comeback, and by the early 2010s, it was growing at a very quick rate. In some territories, vinyl is now more popular than it has been since the late 1980s, though vinyl records still make up only a marginal percentage (less than 6%) of overall music sales."},{"id":2589,"text":"Lt Col Megh Singh (born 1 March 1988) is an Indian Army officer who has been awarded the Ashok Chakra, the highest military decoration for gallantry in the face of the enemy, for his role in Operation Vijay, an ambush against Pakistani troops in Jammu and Kashmir on 12 September 2016.

FPALM and STORM are based on the use of a photosensor that detects light scattered from target objects and uses optical reconstruction methods to generate a three-dimensional image. The majority of FPALM and STORM studies have been performed using silicon probes, which offer high spatial resolution, long scan time, and small size. However, the use of silicon probes also has several disadvantages, including the need for cryogenic conditions and the susceptibility to damage from water and other chemicals. The development of organic semiconductor photo detectors has led to the development of PALM and STORM using organic photo probes. By using organic photo detectors, PALM and STORM can be implemented in a variety of devices including mobile phones, digital cameras, and microscopes.

The Shapiro time delay effect is a strange phenomenon that was first predicted by physicist Irwin Shapiro in the early 1960s. It occurs when the gravitational field of an object affects the time passing in a surrounding medium. The effect is due to the way that gravity works - it affects the movement of particles and objects inside a gravitational field. This can cause them to experience a delay in their natural progression, or even to stop altogether. The Shapiro time delay effect can have strange and unexpected consequences. For example, it has been shown to cause objects to move faster in certain directions than they would otherwise, and it can even cause them to fall towards a central point faster than they would if there were no gravitational field present. Although the effect is still relatively unknown, researchers are continuing to explore its potential implications."},{"id":2610,"text":"Warren N.

The owners came from a variety of backgrounds, with Nate Tilden also co-owning Clyde Common and Elias Cairo having background as a chef and first generation Greek-American.

Nate Tilden and Elias Cairo worked together at Castagna prior to opening Olympia Provisions, where Cairo served as head chef. The company began by selling their salami exclusively at farmers' markets and in their restaurant. After receiving nationwide recognition they needed to expand their production facility to meet their demand. In April 2011, Olympia Provisions opened a second restaurant alongside a 4,000 square foot production facility. Two years later, Olympia Provisions had outgrown its second production facility, and in February 2014 production moved to a 34,000 square foot building two blocks from the Southeast restaurant.

Teacher candidates who are learning to become teachers are asked to co-teach with experienced associate teachers, whereby the classroom responsibilities are shared, and the teacher candidate can learn from the associate teacher. Regular classroom teachers and special education teachers can be paired in co-teaching relationships to benefit inclusion of students with special needs. To evaluate the effectiveness of co-teaching, partnerships can use the Magiera-Simmons Quality Indicator Model of Co-Teaching, which gives standard definitions for co-teaching skills through 25 quality indicators and a rating scale.

Edwards is widely regarded as one of America's most important and original philosophical theologians. Edwards' theological work is broad in scope, but rooted in the pedobaptist Puritan heritage as exemplified in the Westminster and Savoy Confessions of Faith. Recent studies have emphasized how thoroughly Edwards grounded his life's work on conceptions of beauty, harmony, and ethical fittingness, and how central The Enlightenment was to his mindset. Edwards played a critical role in shaping the First Great Awakening, and oversaw some of the first revivals in 1733\u201335 at his church in Northampton, Massachusetts. His theological work gave rise to a distinct school of theology known as the New England theology. Edwards delivered the sermon \"Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God\", a classic of early American literature, during another revival in 1741, following George Whitefield's tour of the Thirteen Colonies. Edwards is well known for his many books, The End for Which God Created the World, The Life of David Brainerd, which inspired thousands of missionaries throughout the 19th century, and Religious Affections, which many Calvinist Evangelicals still read today. Edwards died from a smallpox inoculation shortly after beginning the presidency at the College of New Jersey in Princeton. He was the grandfather of Aaron Burr, the third United States vice president."},{"id":2802,"text":"MTV Movie Awards host Amy Schumer had some hits and misses during the show .

The engraving of gemstones was a major luxury art form in the Ancient world, and an important one in some later periods. Strictly speaking, engraving means carving in intaglio (with the design cut into the flat background of the stone), but relief carvings (with the design projecting out of the background as in nearly all cameos) are also covered by the term. This article uses cameo in its strict sense, to denote a carving exploiting layers of differently coloured stone. The activity is also called gem carving and the artists gem-cutters. References to antique gems and intaglios in a jewellery context will almost always mean carved gems; when referring to monumental sculpture, counter-relief, meaning the same as intaglio, is more likely to be used. Vessels like the Cup of the Ptolemies and heads or figures carved in the round are also known as hardstone carvings."},{"id":2813,"text":"Unnamed child from Medina , Ohio , allegedly swiped cash from bedside table .

There is no precise definition of a Basque Colombian, as the term can be used to describe anyone with Basque ancestry, whether they live in Colombia or not. However, the term is most commonly used to describe people who have Basque heritage and who live in Colombia. There is a long history of Basque immigration to Colombia. The first Basques to arrive in the country were likely settlers who arrived in the 18th century as part of the Spanish colonial empire. However, it was not until the late 19th century that large numbers of Basques began to arrive in Colombia. This influx of Basques was largely due to the need for workers on the coffee and banana plantations that were being developed in the country at this time. Today, there are an estimated 200,000 Basque Colombians living in Colombia. They make up a significant minority within Colombian society, and they have played a significant role in the development of the country.

The French alphabet has 28 letters, which are divided into five groups of seven letters each: A, \u00c0, \u00c8, \u00c9, I, O. These five groups are called \"semivowels\". The semivowels are treated as their own letter group, and each letter in this group has an corresponding letter in the other four groups. The letters in the first group (A-J) are all pronounced \/a\/, the letters in the second group (K-Z) are all pronounced \/k\/, the letters in the third group (a-j) are pronounced \/\u0251\/, and the letters in the fourth group (k-z) are pronounced \/\u0283\/.

Historian of science Hans-J\u00f6rg Rheinberger defines an experimental system as: \"A basic unit of experimental activity combining local, technical, instrumental, institutional, social, and epistemic aspects.\" Scientists (particularly laboratory biologists) and historians and philosophers of biology have pointed to the development and spread of successful experimental systems, such as those based on popular model organism or scientific apparatus, as key elements in the history of science, particularly since the early 20th century. The choice of an appropriate experimental system is often seen as critical for a scientist's long-term success, as experimental systems can be very productive for some kinds of questions and less productive for others, acquiring a sort of momentum that takes research in unpredicted directions. A successful experimental system must be stable and reproducible enough for scientists to make sense of the system's behavior, but variable and unpredictable enough that it can produce useful results. In many cases, a well-understood experimental system can be \"black-boxed\" as a standard technique, which can then be a component of other experimental systems.

This can include work in television and film, as well as print media. Despite increasing numbers of women in the industry, women continue to be underrepresented both behind the camera and in leading roles. The lack of female representation in the media has been acknowledged by various organizations and individuals. In 2016, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) declared September 23 International Women's Day. In their report on gender equality in the media, UNESCO highlighted \"the lack of feminine representation\" as an obstacle to women's advancement in the media industry. The history of women in the media is often linked to their role as mothers and wives. In early decades of broadcasting, women were primarily employed as secretaries and producers. As broadcasting became more professionalized and began to appeal to a wider audience, women began to enter the field in larger numbers. However, they continued to be underrepresented both behind the camera and in leading roles. In recent years, there has been an increase in female representation in the media. This has been due in part to changes in social norms, which have led to increased acceptance of women in professional roles. Furthermore, technological advances have made it easier for women to participate in the media industry. For example, digital media allows for a greater range of creative expression than traditional media formats.

The forts were mainly defensive works constructed in the late stages of the Republic and the first two centuries of the Empire to protect the regions under Roman control from invasion and barbarian raids. The largest forts included those of Vaison-la-Romaine, Caesarea Maritima and Forte dei Marmi. The origins of the Forts of Rome date back to around 300 BC, when the Romans began to build a series of border fortifications to protect their territory from their enemies. At its peak, during the 2nd century BC, the Roman army had over 100 forts across Italy. The Forts were all built on strategic points, such as hills and river crossings, allowing them to dominate their surrounding area. The Forts of Rome played an important role in the history of Rome, not only as a means of defense, but also as a source of income for the government. The construction of new forts often coincided with major political events, such as wars or changes in government. The Forts also served as a place of refuge for the population in times of emergency. Despite their importance, the Forts of Rome eventually fell into disrepair and were abandoned throughout much of Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages.

He was the nephew of Pope Leo IX and the brother of cardinal Humbert II of Baggio. In 1049, on the death of Pope Nicholas II, a dispute arose as to who should be elected to succeed him. Two candidates were nominated by the two most important factions in Rome: Cardinal Humbert II, brother of Honorius II, and the antipope John XIX. The latter was supported by King Henry III of Germany, who regarded him as a more reliable ally against the Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV; while the former was backed by the Roman clergy and people. Both factions put forward their candidates to the people in Rome, but the majority chose John XIX. In response, Humbert and his followers elected Honorius II as an antipope in opposition to John XIX. This represented a break with traditional papal practice, which had been for one cardinal to be elected as pope after another died in office, so that the succession would remain within the family of the late pope. Honorius was consecrated at a hastily arranged ceremony at Saint Peter's Basilica on 17 November 1049. He took the name Honorius II in honour of his uncle Leo IX, who had recently died. In spite of his antipope status, Honorius enjoyed some support from some sections of the Roman population.

However, there are several fundamental techniques that are common to all guqin players. The guqin is a plucked stringed instrument with a pear-shaped body and a single neck. The strings are typically tuned in fifths, but some players use alternate tunings. The instrument has eight strings, which are played with the fingers of both hands. Guqin playing can be divided into three main styles: fingerstyle, classical, and modern. Fingerstyle guqin playing is the simplest and most basic approach. Players simply pluck the strings with their fingers, without having to use any fingerpicks or other special techniques. This style is usually used for simple melodies and is often used as a warm-up exercise before playing more difficult pieces. Classical guqin playing is characterized by a more complex fingerstyle approach combined with some use of fingerpicks. Classical guqin players often use pentatonic scales and arpeggios to create harmonic compositions. Modern guqin playing is the most advanced style, and is often used for solo pieces or in combination with other instruments such as the piano or violin. Modern guqin players often use extended techniques such as looping and slides to create new harmonic sounds."},{"id":3262,"text":"The Museo Provinciale Campano di Capua (commonly referred to as Museo Campano) is a provincial museum located in Capua, southern Italy.

Economic packaging and transportation There are three levels, moving from operational, to tactical and finally strategic. Common sense: Product and packaging must be designed so it is easy to ship and shelf (for instance, Rubbermaid design that fits Walmart's 14x14 shelving). Making a product much stronger and more rugged than necessary for its normal function typically increases parts cost, but sometimes it lowers the net cost by reducing the cost of padding and protection for shipping.

It is the only part of the town centre that has survived decades of redevelopment. As a result, all of the buildings on the lane have been designated by English Heritage as Grade II listed buildings. The lane is significant as it was once part of the prehistoric route through the town which meandered from Hathershaw, via Water Street, Market Place, Church Lane, Church Street, Bow Street, Wallshaw Place, Fowleach, Cross Street then on through Hey to Yorkshire. Its existence and name are due to its proximity to Oldham Parish Church. The current church building is a relatively recent addition but there have been churches on that site since the 11th century. Archaeologists recognise Church Lane to predate the Romans and a road that is \"probably as old as human life in this corner of England.\""},{"id":3319,"text":"Socrates Krishnan Valath, (born 1963) is an Indian philosopher and cognitive scientist.

Many studies have revealed the high benefit of exclusive breastfeeding to both mother and child, documenting that exclusive breastfeeding for a period of 6 months significantly reduces transmission, provides the infant with a greater chance of survival in the first year of life, and helps the mother to recover from the negative health effects of birth much more quickly."},{"id":3410,"text":"Ben Stiller announces that Penelope Cruz will join cast of `` Zoolander 2 '' `` Zoolander 2 '' is scheduled for release in 2016 ."},{"id":3411,"text":"Charlene Wall Jeffs , 58 , is one of a reported nine wives of Lyle Jeffs .

The aria itself is divided into two sections: a tender melancholic opening part which recalls Maddalena's misadventures; and a heroic second part, full of high arching phrases, which suggested the voice of the god of love.

At times it refers to the measure of food access and availability at the community level, and at other times to a goal or framework for place-based food systems. It builds upon the more commonly understood concept of food security, which refers to food access and availability at an individual or household level (in health and social policy, for instance) and at a national or global level (e.g., in international development and aid work). Hamm and Bellows (2003) define CFS as \u201ca situation in which all community residents obtain a safe, culturally acceptable, nutritionally adequate diet through a sustainable food system that maximizes community self-reliance and social justice\u201d (p.\u00a037).  CFS involves social, economic, and institutional factors, and their interrelationships within a community that impact availability and access to resources to produce food locally. It takes into account environmental sustainability and social fairness through measures of the availability and affordability of food in that community relative to the financial resources available to purchase or produce it. CFS' Global Scale In industrialized countries, income-related food security is measured at both the individual and household levels whereas in non-industrialized countries it is most often measured in terms of under-nutrition and malnutrition through anthropometric measurements.  Indicators of individual food insecurity include limited food selection, suboptimal nutrient intakes and severe nutrient inadequacies. Household food insecurity measures food intake of adults and children as a group within the home in relation to household income and food cost expenditure. Markers of vulnerability to food insecurity in Canada and U.S. include low income, reliance on welfare, lone motherhood, lack of home ownership, and Aboriginal status."},{"id":3569,"text":"Around 200,000 people were deported to the Nazi camp in northern Germany during World War Two .

Epithets are used because of the constraints of the dactylic hexameter (i.e., it is convenient to have a stockpile of metrically fitting phrases to add to a name) and because of the oral transmission of the poems; they are mnemonic aids to the singer and the audience alike. Formulae in epic poetry from various Indo-European traditions may be traced to a common tradition. For example, the phrase for \"everlasting glory\" or \"undying fame\" can be found in the Homeric Greek as \/ and Vedic Sanskrit as \/ . These two phrases were, in terms of historical linguistics, equivalent in phonology, accentuation, and quantity (syllable length). In other words, they descend from a fragment of poetic diction (reconstructable as Proto-Indo-European ) which was handed down in parallel over many centuries, in continually diverging forms, by generations of singers whose ultimate ancestors shared an archetypal repertoire of poetic formulae and narrative themes."},{"id":3580,"text":"Lee Allan Bonneau, 6, died from blunt force trauma to the head in August 2013 following a savage attack on a reservation in Saskatchewan.

It is also called a symbolic link, because the file references a symbol instead of the filename itself. A hard link is created when two files are attached to each other with a special file system attribute called hard link count. The first file has a hard link count of 1, and the second file has a hard link count of 2. When the files are accessed, their data is combined into a single stream and processed as if it were one file. The hard link count is not visible to users or programs. The feature was introduced in Unix-like operating systems in the 1980s as a way to share files between multiple users without having to copy the files.

It is obtained by calculating the correlation coefficient between two variables. The Pearson product\u2013moment correlation coefficient is the most commonly used correlation coefficient. It measures the linear association between two variables and has a value between \u22121 and 1. A positive correlation indicates that as one variable increases, the other variable tends to increase as well, while a negative correlation indicates that as one variable increases, the other variable tends to decrease. Correlation can be used to identify relationships between variables that might not be apparent when looking at individual values. For example, if you are studying the effects of different types of diets on weight gain, it can be helpful to study the correlations between weight and diet type (e.g., high-fat, low-fat, moderate-fat) in order to identify which types of diets are most closely associated with weight gain."},{"id":3729,"text":"Manchester City defeated West Ham 2-0 in their Premier League clash .

Stone moulds are artefacts made from stone, typically used in the production of figurines, reliefs and other sculptures. They are one of the oldest forms of sculptural decoration, dating back to the prehistoric period. They were generally used in the eastern Mediterranean and Europe until the early modern period, when they were replaced by metal Casting. The most common type of stone mould is the 'slab mold', which is a rectangular block with a series of smooth indentations on one or both sides. This type was used to produce reliefs, and was especially popular in Ancient Greece. The 'pillar mold' is similar to the slab mold, but has smaller indentations on either side of the block. It was used to produce statuary, and was particularly popular in Ancient Rome. The 'cusp mold' is a slender block with triangular indentations on one or both sides.

This usually happens over a period of time and can be seen within a few generations. There are families with immigrant grandparents who speak primarily their native language and some of the new country's language. Their children then speak both languages, but the grandchildren only speak the dominant or preferred language of the new location. The United States provides many examples of this phenomenon. For example, a woman born and raised in Mexico moved to the United States and learned a bit of English and spoke a great deal of Spanish as well. Her daughter, born and reared in the U.S. was equally fluent in both Spanish and English (bilingual). The grandchild of the Mexican immigrant, who was born and has been reared in the U.S., speaks only English. This process is due to the pressure that is put on the individuals by the society of the new environment. They cannot survive well without the primary language spoken in their new home and eventually, since fewer and fewer people speak the \"old\" native language, it is not used as often, as it is not a necessity, and is lost."},{"id":3796,"text":"The three men , who are in their 50s are all from the York area .

Cultural inventions include sets of behaviour adopted by groups of people. They are perpetuated by being passed on to others within the group or outside it. They are also passed on to future groups and generations. Sources of cultural invention can either come from outside a specific group or from within that group. Allan Hanson, a postmodern anthropologist, believed that the analytical purpose of studying cultural inventions was not to uncover which portions of a culture's belief systems are invented, but rather to study how cultural inventions become accepted as authentic within groups. This notion has been met with criticism from within the anthropological community as well as from outside sources, and has been referred to as both politically revisionist and anti-native. The fear is that viewing cultural invention as a process which leads to something authentic and widely accepted may undermine indigenous people's traditions in addition to questioning the authority they have over their own culture."},{"id":3804,"text":"London Mayor praised Coalition for having kept down unemployment and not returning to the dole queues of 1980s Britain.

Particulate inheritance is a pattern of inheritance in which a parent's phenotype is passed on to their offspring in the form of small pieces of DNA or RNA. This type of inheritance occurs when the parental cells break down and release their contents into the surrounding environment, where the small genetic material can be absorbed by the child cells. This process can occur during fertilization, during early development, or even after death. Particulate inheritance can have a significant impact on the development of a child's phenotype. For example, if a parent has a disease that is caused by a genetic mutation, their children may be at risk for developing that disease as well.

It is a small ribosomal subunit, and is found in the nucleolus of eukaryotic cells. The 5S rRNA plays a role in the assembly of the ribosomes, and in the biogenesis of proteins. The 5S rRNA gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 5. The 5S rRNA gene consists of 23 exons and spans about 50,000 base pairs. This gene is composed of three main structural domains: the amino-terminal domain, the central domain, and the carboxy-terminal domain. The amino-terminal domain contains the start codon, and initiates translation. The central domain contains the ribosomal protein synthesis initiation site, while the carboxy-terminal domain plays a role in protein stability and post-translational modifications. The 5S rRNA is important for the assembly of the ribosomes. The 5S rRNA binds to 23 other proteins, called ribosomal proteins (rps), to form a functional ribosome. These proteins include rRNAs from other genes, such as 18S rRNA, 19S rRNA, 30S rRNA, and 37S rRNA.

Ideologically a black nationalist and Pan-Africanist, his ideas came to be known as Garveyism. Garvey was born to a moderately prosperous Afro-Jamaican family in Saint Ann's Bay and apprenticed into the print trade as a teenager. Working in Kingston, he became involved in trade unionism before living briefly in Costa Rica, Panama, and England. Returning to Jamaica, he founded UNIA in 1914. In 1916, he moved to the United States and established a UNIA branch in New York City's Harlem district. Emphasising unity between Africans and the African diaspora, he campaigned for an end to European colonial rule across Africa and the political unification of the continent. He envisioned a unified Africa as a one-party state, governed by himself, that would enact laws to ensure black racial purity. Although he never visited the continent, he was committed to the Back-to-Africa movement, arguing that part of the diaspora should migrate there. Garveyist ideas became increasingly popular and UNIA grew in membership.
